^ CALL FOR PAPERS Special Issue of &NAME Journal of Natural Language Engineering 
^ Software Architecture for Language Engineering 
^ &NAME : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME 
^ A number of researchers argued in the early and middle &NUM that the field of computational infrastructure , or architecture , for Natural Language Processing , merited an increase in attention . 
^ The reasoning was that the increasingly large-scale and technologically significant nature of &NAME science was placing increasing burdens of an engineering nature on &NAME workers seeking robust and practical methods . 
^ Over the intervening period a number of significant systems and practices have been developed in what we may call Software Architecture for Language Engineering . 
^ Of the most prominent are : 
^ * RAGS , Reference Architecture for Generation Systems ( &NAME and &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME , CES , &NAME ( &NAME , Vassar , etc. ) 
^ * ATLAS ( &NAME , &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME ( &NAME &NAME ) 
^ * ProtE9gE9 ( &NAME ) 
^ * GATE , a General Architecture for Text Engineering ( &NAME ) . 
^ This special issue represents an opportunity for pracititioners in this area to report their work in a coordinated setting . 
^ The value to the community at large will be to get a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in infrastructural work , which may indicate where further take-up of these systems can be of benefit . 
^ &CHAR wide range of topics are relevant , from reference architectures to web services , from component repositories to language resource standardisation , from grid-based distribution to comparative studies of different architectures . 
^ Important dates : 
^ 1st July &NUM deadline for submission of papers 1st November &NUM notification of acceptance 15th December &NUM final copy due 1st June &NUM special issue publication date 
^ &NAME : 
^ Initial submissions should be sent electronically in &NAME format to 
^ &NAME &NAME - &EMAIL 
^ &NAME instructions for final submissions are available from &NAME at &WEBSITE

^ Organized by the University of &NAME &NUM 
^ We are happy to announce that registration for the 11th &NAME &NAME School is now open . 
^ For this school we have chosen a topic of great relevance to researchers and developers in &NAME and in other multilingual environments : the use of language and speech technology in language learning , both of spoken and of written language . 
^ The goal of this workshop is to get &NAME researchers on a track that will eventually contribute to an important application area . 
^ The underlying vision ( or dream ) is The automatic animated language tutor . 
^ + &NAME and aims : 
^ We see the school as mainly research and development oriented , and hence the primary audience are researchers , developers and integrators who will make our vision happen ( rather than teachers who would use it ) .

^ The aims are : 
^ * to make the students familiar with the main principles and problems of language learning / teaching 
^ * to make them familiar with current best practice in computer assisted language learning 
^ * to make them familiar with the main challenges in computer assisted language learning 
^ Participants are expected to have a general computational background and some familiarity with language or speech research and / or processing . 
^ After completion of the summer school participants should be able to function in teams aimed at designing or implementing tools , environments or courses for &NAME &NAME Language &NAME ( abbreviated CALL ) . 
^ + &NAME programme : 
^ The provisonal programme is available at 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ The 2-weeks programme comprises the following courses : 
^ * Introduction to CALL ( &NAME : &NAME &NAME , [ &NAME of &NAME ] ) 
^ * Introduction to natural language processing for CALL ( &NAME : &NAME &NAME [ &NAME of &NAME ] ) 
^ * Introduction to speech processing for CALL ( &NAME : &NAME &NAME [ &NAME &NAME ] ) 
^ * Using &NAME tools in CALL ( hands-on ) ( &NAME : &NAME &NAME [ &NAME of &NAME ] )

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Actually the template for the workplan on the web does n't have a slot for supervisor name ( just asks for supervisors ' signature , which some of mine did n't get due to me being away ) and does n't distinguish between backed-up and non-backed-up space . 
^ So we should fix that in any event . 
^ Plus give the &NAME to the supervisors , which I do n't think happened this year . 
^ I do n't know whether we do the whole workplan &NAME or not , but I do think we should do the special resources part of it &NAME .

^ Hi , 
^ I 've nearly finished up a program to do the term overlap analysis like we were talking about : it 's basically a perl script that parses the &NAME and then pipes the ( text ) tag from each news item to the tokeniser , tagger and lemmatizer . 
^ The bit I have n't done yet is to remove closed class words : is there an easy way to do this in RASP , or is it a case of looking for the closed class tags and stripping them out ?

^ I would go farther than &NAME and say that subcategorization frames are pretty much gone from contemporary syntactic analysis . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ That 's a rather surprising statement . 
^ The contemporary syntactic frameworks with an interest in empirical coverage ( cf. &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME ) crucially rely on subcategorization information . 
^ A subcategorization frame encodes the syntactic potential / requirements of a lexical item and as such is the key to the syntactic analysis . 
^ Some of the subcategorization frames can be inferred from linking regularities based on the lexical semantics , while others have to be lexically stipulated . 
^ In computational linguistics , learning subcategorization frames from corpora also is an active research field , underlining their empirical relevance .

^ &NAME server &NAME not responding still trying have been been replaced by head-complement relations , in many cases involving functional heads , like ' little &CHAR ' , which plays a role in the 'double object ' construction .

^ 6th INTEX &NAME &NAME , &NUM May &NUM 
^ Call for papers - &NAME : March 15th 
^ &NAME : Bulgarian Association for Computational Linguistics - &NAME 
^ We invite the submission of papers for the forthcoming sixth INTEX workshop , to be held in &NAME from &NUM May &NUM . 
^ &NAME is a linguistic development environment that includes large-coverage dictionaries and grammars , and parses texts of several million words in real time . 
^ &NAME includes tools to create and maintain large-coverage lexical resources , as well as morphological and syntactic grammars . 
^ Dictionaries and grammars are applied to texts in order to locate morphological , lexical and syntactic patterns , remove ambiguities , and tag simple and compound words . 
^ &NAME is used by several research centers to rapidly construct extractors to identify semantic units in large texts , such as Proper names of persons , locations , technical expressions of finance , etc. INTEX can build lemmatized concordances and indices of large texts with respect to all types of &NAME State patterns . 
^ &NUM interesting characteristic of INTEX is that the system is open : users can add their own resources use the INTEX programs to build new applications , and add their own programs to modify INTEX . 
^ &NAME is now used in over &NUM research centers as a linguistic platform , an information retrieval system , to teach second languages , as a terminological extractor , as well as to teach computational linguistics to students . 
^ As in the previous workshops , ( &NUM , &NUM , &NUM , &NUM and &NUM ) , this meeting will be the opportunity for INTEX users to meet and to exchange their experience of development , research or teaching . 
^ It will also be the occasion to present the recent developments of INTEX and &NAME . 
^ Please , send before March 15th &NUM a one-page abstract to : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME or &NAME &NAME , 
^ if possible by email . 
^ The abstract , in French or English , should contain the title of the article , name , author affiliations , surface mail and electronic address of each author . 
^ All papers will be reviewed by the following programme committee :

^ We appologies for multiple posting 
^ &NAME and Information Extraction 
^ International Workshop held as part of the EUROLAN' &NUM &NAME School July &NUM - August &NUM , &NUM &NAME , &NAME 
^ New extended dead-line : 5th May &NUM 
^ Call for Papers Information Extraction systems were designed to filter , to select and to classify the increasing amount of information available nowadays , mainly on the Web . 
^ Most of them were based on shallow natural language processing techniques , but semantics was not really used , due to the unavailability of generic ontologies . 
^ During last years , some generic ontologies become available and a lot of research projets tried to take into account semantic aspects to obtain more precise results for &NAME systems . 
^ Meanwhile , important efforts concentrate on developping tools for semi- automatic building of domain-specific ontologies , based on &NAME and text- mining techniques . 
^ This workshop will provide a forum for discussion between leading names in the field and researchers involved in the development of ontology-based &NAME systems or semi-automatic tools for building ontologies . 
^ We would like to invite researchers , master and Ph. &NAME students to submit their original and unpublished work to the workshop . 
^ Topics of interest include but are not limited to : 
^ - semantic &NAME ; 
^ - content-based indexing and retrieval ; 
^ - robust analysis of language data ; 
^ - text mining ; 
^ - platforms for semi-automatic ontology extraction ; 
^ - formalisms for ontology representations . 
^ &NAME &NAME Authors are invited to submit a &NUM pages extended abstract in electronic form ( postscript or &NAME ) by 05th May &NUM . 
^ Authors of accepted papers should submit the final version in electronic format not later than 15th of June . 
^ The documents must be in either postscript or pdf format ( &NAME is encouraged , but postscript documents are acceptable as well ) . 
^ If you have problems delivering your paper in &NUM of these formats , please contact the organising comittee . 
^ Maximum length of paper should be about &NUM pages . 
^ This workshop uses the same guidelines as EACL-2003 . 
^ The instructions can be found at &WEBSITE numbers , headers or footers . 
^ If you have any problem following the style please contact the organising committee as soon as possible . 
^ All the papers should be send to &EMAIL 
^ Important Dates &NAME &NAME : 05th May &NUM 
^ Notification of &NAME : 20th May &NUM 
^ Camera-ready Papers : 15th June &NUM 
^ Demos of working or under development systems are encouraged . 
^ Registration People wanting to attend the workshop must be registered at the Eurolan' &NUM School . 
^ Participation to the workshop is open to all Eurolan' &NUM attendants .

^ INSTITUTION : &CHAR of &NAME &NAME &NAME

^ DATE : Tuesday , March &NUM , &NUM 
^ TIME : &NUM : &NUM - &NUM : &NUM

^ TITLE : &NAME &NAME Efficiency for &NAME &NAME 
^ Spatial databases are widely used in applications such as geographical information systems ( &NAME ) and computer-aided design ( &NAME ) systems . 
^ Due to the interative nature of the applications and the complexity of the objects , spatial databases face some unique challenges compared to more traditional database systems . 
^ As part of the &NAME &NAME Library Project , our work addresses some of these challenges , with a focus on efficient access of large spatial datasets at different levels . 
^ At the collection level , browsing allows users to visualize the selectivity of multiple queries before evaluating the queries at the database , thereby provides an effcient way to explore the content of a dataset . 
^ For spatial browsing , we first identify a set of spatial relations using a simplified itersection model . 
^ We then propose &NUM storage-efficient approximation algorithms based the &NAME &NAME . 
^ We also extend the &NAME Histogram as a framework for spatial join selectivity estimation . 
^ Based on the characteristics of different datasets , different probabilistic models can be plugged into this framework to provide better estimation results . 
^ At the object level , we propose a novel approach to accelerate spatial selections and joins with computer graphics hardware . 
^ Spatial database operations are typically performed in &NUM steps . 
^ In the {em filtering} step , indexes and the minimum bounding rectangles ( &NAME ) of the objects are used to quickly determine a set of candidates objects , and in the {em refinement} step , the actual geometries of the objects are retrieved and compared to the query geometry or each other . 
^ Because of the complexity of the computational geometry algorithms involved , the &NAME cost of the refinement step is usually the dominant cost of the operation for complex geometries such as polygons . 
^ We propose a novel approach to address this problem using efficient rendering and searching capabilities of modern graphics hardware . 
^ This approach does not require expensive pre-processing of the data or changes to existing storage and index structures , and it applies to both intersection and distance predicates . 
^ Our experiments with real world datasets show that by combining hardware and software methods , the overall computational cost can be reduced substantially for both spatial selections and joins .

^ * * * * Extended Deadline for &NAME : &NAME 10th &NUM * * * * 
^ Joint Conference combining the 7th International Workshop of the European Association for &NAME Translation and the 4th Controlled Languag &CHAR &NAME &NAME 
^ Main Conference theme : Controlled Language Translation 
^ &NAME : &NAME City University , &NAME 
^ Dates : 15th-17th May , &NUM 
^ Conference &NAME : &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME Speakers : &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME and Coordinator of &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME 
^ Over the years , there have been many conferences on &NAME , involving rule-based approaches , statistical and example-based approaches , hybrid and multi-engine approaches as well as those limited to particular sublangu age domains . 
^ In addition , there has been an increased level of interest in controlled languages , culminating in the series of Workshops on control led language applications . 
^ These have given impetus to both monolingual and multilingual guidelines and applications using controlled language , for many different languages . 
^ Controlled languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars an &CHAR dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity . 
^ Traditionally , controlled languages fall into &NUM major categories : those that improve readability for human readers , particularly non-native speakers , and those that improve computational processing of the text . 
^ It is often claimed that machine-oriented controlled language should be of particular benefit when it comes to the use of translation tools ( including machine translation , translation memory , multilingual terminology tools etc. ) . 
^ &NAME has shown that high quality &NAME systems can be designed for specialized domains ( e.g. METEO ) . 
^ However , the area of controlled translation has remained relatively unaddressed . 
^ This is rather strange given its undoubted importance . 
^ Such examples that exist use rule-based &NAME ( &NAME ) systems to translate controlled language documentation , e.g. &NAME 's &NAME and &NAME 's &NAME system , and General &NAME &NAME and &NAME , etc. However , fine-tuning general systems designed for use wi th unrestricted texts to derive specific , restricted applications is compl ex and expensive . 
^ The primary aim of this unique conference , therefore , is to elicit pape rs on controlled translation , and provide a forum in which the problems may &CHAR &CHAR outlined , possible solutions proposed , and in general to bring together developers , implementors , researchers and end-users from the publicatio ns , authoring , translation and localization fields to discuss how ideas fro &CHAR both the authoring and translation camps might be integrated in this common area . 
^ Some specific topics which might be addressed include : 
^ * What is controlled translation ? 
^ * &NAME and controlled translation . 
^ * TM / &NAME and controlled translation . 
^ * Influence and interplay of controlled language upon both source-language parsing and target-language generation in an &NAME system . 
^ * Role of the lexicon in controlled translation . 
^ * Can we expect better controlled translations from a hybrid approac &CHAR ? 
^ Or from a multi-engine approach ? 
^ * Towards a &NAME for controlled translation - the way ahead ? 
^ In addition , we welcome contributions on &NAME as well as on controlled language which do not address the main theme per se . 
^ Please consult the conference &NAME ( &WEBSITE 
^ Important Dates / Prizes for ' Best Papers ' 
^ Owing to a large number of requests for an extension to the original deadline of &NAME 29th ( and with apologies , and thanks , to those who have submitted so far ) , we have come up with the following , new schedule :

^ Was trying to think of something for the &NAME &NAME . 
^ The abstract deadline is really soon but the conference is some way off - the paper is n't due till next January . 
^ Can you have a look at it for me . 
^ &NAME 
^ In language acquisition a distinction is made between competence , the learner 's knowledge of language , and performance , the learners actual use of language . 
^ A child 's produced speech does not necessarily reflect all the linguistic knowledge they have acquired . 
^ In fact children seem to understand many lexemes and constructs that they do not use themselves ( &CHAR &NAME et &NAME ) . 
^ Child grammars based solely on speech production are inadequate representations of the child 's linguistic competence . 
^ Accordingly , clever &NAME experiments have been constructed which attempt to infer the linguistic competence ( i.e. the child 's internal grammar ) using comprehension tests ( eg. &NAME , &NAME and &NAME amongst many others ) . 
^ In this work , a computational approach has been adopted to investigate the discrepancy between language competence and production . 
^ &CHAR modeled learner receives input from a corpus of sentences annotated with logical forms . 
^ The corpus used , the &NAME corpus , is a longitudinal study of a child 's natural interactions with her caretakers over a &NUM year period . 
^ The modeled learner consists of &NUM modules : a semantics learner and a syntax learner . 
^ On receiving an input utterance the semantics learner attempts to learn a mapping between words and meanings , building a lexicon containing the meaning associated with each word sense . 
^ This is achieved by analyzing utterance-meaning pairs using cross-situational techniques ( following Siskind &NUM ) . 
^ Subsequently , the syntax learning module tries to learn possible syntactic categories for each word sense using , as an initial guide , the semantic predicates associated with the word sense . 
^ Hence the learner exploits the idea of semantic bootstrapping in order to learn syntax ( &NAME &NUM ) . 
^ &NUM grammars are acquired : &NUM from a corpus of the child-directed utterances and one from a corpus of the child 's responses . 
^ The grammar acquired from the child-directed utterances should be a super-grammar of the child 's internal grammar and in a perfect speaker-hearer situation they will be equivalent . 
^ This grammar is representative of the child 's competence . 
^ The grammar acquired from the child 's responses is representative of the child 's production . 
^ Since , due to memory lapses or shifts in attention , the child sometimes produces utterances it considers ungrammatical , the modeled learner is designed to deal with noise , converging on the most likely grammar for the utterances produced . 
^ By utilizing the perfect speaker-hearer assumption , the &NUM grammars may be compared in the investigation of the discrepancy between production and competence at different times during the acquisition period . 
^ In the full paper the results of this investigation are reported . 
^ The difference between known vocabulary vs. produced vocabulary are discussed as well as the idea that consistently produced constructs , which can not be attributed to the child 's internal grammar , give evidence to suggest some properties of a universal grammar .

^ Hi , 
^ I seem to recall that there was a short paper floating about which described the reuters category hierarchy , and that it was n't available on line . 
^ Do you have a copy of it I could borrow ? 
^ I 've tagged just over &NUM documents from the corpus - I figured this would be enough to get a good idea of term overlap . 
^ I 'm running scripts now that extract the terms from the tagged versions and collects them into &NUM file per category ; but rather than do that for each category I wanted to choose the best subcats of &CHAR and &CHAR to compare , hence my interest in the paper . 
^ I 've also read some reasonably interesting papers that use quite unusual representations for features : &NUM paper enumerates all possible subtrees in the parses of the training corpus , the other all ( possibly non-contiguous ) subsequences . 
^ Both lead to crazy feature vector sizes , but since &NAME are n't explicitly concerned with the vector length this is n't really a problem . 
^ Neither approach is really linguistically motivated though . 
^ The best effort I 've seen was by &NAME and &NAME who use latent semantic indexing to compute a linear transform of the &NAME kernel , supposedly warping the feature vector space such that semantically related terms get moved together ( another approach is to use wordnet , and the distance in the semantic net between &NUM terms , to compute a similar transform ) . 
^ Anyway , just thought I 'd let you know how I 'm getting on .

^ &NAME Group 's Integrated Business Intelligence Symposium 
^ Dear &NAME 
^ &NAME Group 's Integrated Business Intelligence Symposium 
^ Attend your first &NAME Group Symposium free of charge 
^ &NAME Group 's Symposia are widely regarded as the de facto Northern European platform for both end-users and vendors to participate in a themed technology debate . 
^ Our Symposia offer our clients the opportunity to hear &NAME Group 's clear and candid views of a technology , case studies by companies who have implemented such technologies , and keynotes from leading vendors . 
^ All this ensures that an attendee leaves with a thorough understanding of the technology , a shortlist of vendors to talk to , and a clear &NAME Group best practice plan for such an implementation . 
^ On &NUM and &NUM June &NUM we are hosting our Integrated Business Intelligence Symposium : ' The Architectures and Technologies that &NAME &NAME Business ' . 
^ This event is the ninth in the very popular series of &NAME Group Symposia , which have led the Northern European debate over the last &NUM years . 
^ As a valued client we are conscious that you may be interested in this technology arena . 
^ I am also aware that you have not attended a &NAME Group Symposium before . 
^ In order that you do not miss out , I would personally like to invite you to attend this event free of charge , if you register by the end of May . 
^ Please note that the number of free places are limited and will be allocated on a first come first served basis . 
^ Your privileged invitation is to attend over both days and hear me explain the value of this technology and my vision of the future of Integrated Business Intelligence . 
^ I will also be joined by my colleague &NAME &NAME , our Research Director , who will be presenting on &NUM June . 
^ Autonomy and Computer Associates , our Platinum Sponsors , will share their vision of how this technology space will develop over the coming years and they , and &NUM other leading Business Intelligence vendors , ( including &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , Information Builders , &NAME and &NAME ) will introduce delegates to their clients who will explain the benefits and pitfalls to avoid , following their experience rolling-out this technology across their Enterprise and the buy-in that is required from Board level . 
^ Naturally , time is made available for clients to meet the vendors involved in each of these implementations and see them demonstrate their solutions in &NAME &NAME , or simply gather information in the Exhibition . 
^ But it 's not all designed to be hard work : I want you to be able to network in the informal sessions and enjoy our hospitality . 
^ Enjoy the fine food and wine - and of course our renowned entertainment - at the &NAME dinner . 
^ This Symposium is designed to be a community for both IT and business executives to meet &NAME Group 's experts and the world 's leading vendors and their clients to assess exactly what value they gained from choosing a specific technology . 
^ I would encourage you to ensure that you are represented by both IT and business management from your organisation to truly assess the value of Integrated Business Intelligence technologies . 
^ The event is due to take place on &NUM and &NUM June &NUM , at the &NAME &NAME &NAME . 
^ For more information on this event , call the Events &NAME on : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM or please download the event brochure from : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ Or to accept my offer of a complimentary place at this event , simply email your name , job title and company name to our Commercial Manager at : &EMAIL . 
^ As demand for these events is usually high please note that places will be allocated on a first come first serve basis , and admission will be at the discretion of &NAME Group . 
^ I look forward to seeing you there . 
^ Yours sincerely 
^ &NAME &NAME Founder and President &NAME Group

^ &NAME , good . 
^ With regards to disk space - since there is no question of getting enough space to &NAME up even every document in the &CHAR * hierarchy ( and it is not even clear that that will be necessary ) , I figured I would ask for a rough 200Mb of disk space .

^ Classifying Text Using Linguistic Features 
^ NAME : &NAME &NAME 
^ &NUM . 
^ INTRODUCTION 
^ Classification of text documents remains an important application of both &NAME and machine learning techniques . 
^ However , current 91state-of-the-art ' approaches adopt a &NAME method of feature identification by constructing the feature vector from some subset of the set of terms present in the candidate document . 
^ It is easily argued that this approach carries with it distinct limitations in its ability to truly characterise a piece of text . 
^ Further , the underlying classification system used in current schemes typically remains the &NAME &NAME ' Classifier : a simple , high performance classifier that produces good results on many classification tasks . 
^ However , the theory of &NAME is underpinned by the assumption that distinct terms in the feature vector are probabilistically independent , clearly an illegal assumption in the 91set of terms ' case . 
^ Thus , &NAME perform well almost in spite of themselves . 
^ Therefore it is important to study different classification formalisms to break through the performance ceiling which &NAME appear to have . 
^ In particular , kernel based classifiers such as Support Vector Machines and Relevance Vector Machines are of considerable interest due to their ability to map non-linearly separable feature spaces onto linearly separable &NUM in which a simple linear classifier may be learnt . 
^ This , along with the removal of the term independence criterion , may allow for much more informed , linguistically motivated feature identification and correspondingly significantly increased classification performance . 
^ &NUM . 
^ AIMS OF THE PROJECT 
^ The aim of this project is to investigate the behaviour and performance of kernel based classification methods on text classification . 
^ In particular the performance of the &NAME &NAME &NAME , a kernel based method that unlike the Support &NAME &NAME is unrestricted by patents , will be investigated , along with its ability to cope with mixed feature vector representations ( i.e. combinations of terms and higher-level linguistic constructs ) . 
^ Achieving this aim will involve the design and implementation of a classifier , the development of a linguistically motivated feature identification technique and the adaptation of the classifier to achieve best performance on a corpus given the feature identification technique . 
^ This project will be considered successful if , upon completion , the performance of kernel based classifiers on text classification has been both empirically measured and theoretically motivated , and the benefit of more informed feature identification techniques has been analysed . 
^ &NUM . 
^ IMPLEMENTATION / APPROACH 
^ a. A linguistically motivated feature identification method will be developed , typically making use of a RASP parse of the corpus to identify linguistic features in the text 
^ b. &CHAR kernel based classifier will be designed and implemented ( most likely in C++ ) . 
^ The main theoretical problem will be the development of a suitable kernel function that maps the feature vector obtained from &CHAR . 
^ onto a linearly separable inner-product feature space . 
^ c. The performance of the classifier on the &NAME corpus ( a corpus with fine grained topic categories ) will be measured and the classifier adapted to overcome classification problems that arose 
^ d. If time permits , the classifier performance will be compared against that of a &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ &NUM . 
^ SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES 
^ The &NAME corpus is required to provide both training and test data for experimentation . 
^ Specifically , I intend to focus on the &CHAR * and &CHAR * hierarchies which should provide sufficient test data to establish performance on fine , medium and coarse grained classification problems . 
^ In order to provide for substantial run-time space requirements , as well as storage space for processed corpus items , 200Mb of additional disk space is required . 
^ &NUM . 
^ TIME SCHEDULE 
^ Weeks &NUM Background reading and familiarisation . 
^ Weeks &NUM Development and evaluation of a baseline classifier and feature identification method 
^ Weeks &NUM &NAME write up of baseline work , implement improvements to classifier based on evaluation process 
^ Weeks &NUM Finish writing up the report .

^ Hi everybody 
^ For a current project involving collocations , a colleague and I need to compute several hundreds of F-E tests , some of which involve very high marginal totals even though the cooccurrence frequencies are very small . 
^ The question now is , do you happen to know of any ( &NAME / &NAME / &NAME ) software that can cope with the enormous sizes of the resulting figures ? 
^ An example : &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM 
^ Some scripts on the web seemed to do the job , but on second looks , the results seemd wrong because transforming tables ( along the main diagonal ) with such high figures lead to different results , inviting the inference that the scripts only computed approximations ... Any idea ( &CHAR ) ?

^ &NAME &NAME ,

^ &NAME Recall 
^ &NAME &NAME Person &NUM &NUM Location &NUM &NUM Organization &NUM &NUM &NAME &NUM &NUM Over subtask &NUM &NUM

^ * ALL * CORRESPONDING ENTITY CONFUSION MATRIX

^ RESPONSE ENTITY BRACKETING 
^ PERSON ORGANIZATION LOCATION TIME DATE MONEY PERCENT SPURIOUS &NUM &NUM 
^ PRESENT BUT WRONG BRACKETING &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM 
^ CORRECT BRACKETING &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM 
^ As you can see , these numbers are from a small sample size so it 's a bit too soon to draw any rigid conclusions ( there was n't a single example of a MONEY or PERCENT entity in the documents being evaluated ) . 
^ However , it does appear that incorrect bracketing is &NUM of RASP 's major failings . 
^ The overall performance RASP achieves in terms of bracketing is the it only manages to correctly bracket ~45% of the key entities correctly ( and only ~52% of the entities it tags are correctly bracketed according to the keys ) . 
^ &NAME tokenisation is to blame for at least some of the bracketing problems , but certainly not the majority . 
^ Other failings include : 
^ - confusion between PERSONs and other ENAMEX subcats . 
^ Because of my ( RASP ) name -- ) ( &NAME ) PERSON mapping , * lots * of things tend to get tagged PERSON and , although most of these are actually a &NAME &NAME entity , quite a few are LOCATIONs or ORGANIZATIONs . 
^ So while precision for ORGANIZATIONs and LOCATIONs is high , recall is very low . 
^ For PERSONs recall is very high , but precision is n't great . 
^ This situation should definitely be improved by augmenting the lexicon with more locative and organization nouns . 
^ ( On the whole , RASP handled &NAME Harbor well , since Harbor tended to be tagged &NAME , same for e.g. Navy_NNJ1 . ) If the subcategorization is ignored , both precision and recall are quite high for the ENAMEX subtask i.e. RASP successfully recognises most ENAMEX entities and that they are ENAMEX entities . 
^ - misclassification of DATEs . 
^ RASP tends to classify these as TIMEs or totally miss them ( e.g. &NUM would be missed since it 's just tagged num ) . 
^ The confusion with TIMEs stems from the fact that the &NAME task definition states that things like Wednesday are DATEs . 
^ So although RASP recognises that it 's a temporal expression from Wednesday 's &NAME tag , it does n't recognise it as a date since the relevant rule in the grammar ... 
^ &NAME &NAME / date : N2 [ &NAME TEMP ] -- ) ( N2 [ &NAME &NAME ] ) H0 
^ ... is n't applicable and , seemingly , rarely is . 
^ - spurious TIMEs . 
^ Expression like ' the time before last ' and ' &NUM days later ' are incorrectly tagged as TIMEs since days and time are tagged &NAME and &NAME . 
^ But e.g. relative time expressions are n't covered by the &NAME task definition . 
^ In general , RASP 's precision for &NAME is not too bad ( &NUM ) but it 's bad at recognising when something is a TEMPEX ( &NUM recall ) . 
^ I need to investigate the NUMEX subtask by looking at a different key file so I 'll get back to you about that , although I 'd still like a meeting to discuss these ( and any more ) results . 
^ Thanks ,

^ &NAME gets the &NAME &NAME working so we can recover the html versions of the pdf / ps files ... 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ I now have this working . 
^ The simplest way I found was to use &NAME . 
^ I enhanced the sample &NAME script included with the &NAME &NAME to pull the results down from the &NAME cache . 
^ This method relies on a &NAME module package called SOAP : : &NAME being installed . 
^ I had &NAME install this on dnieper , so you 'll need to ssh to dnieper to try it out , or have him install it on your machine . 
^ To try it out , copy the &NUM files from /homes / ekh29 / google . 
^ Run google.pl with no arguments for the help screen . 
^ Usage is 
^ google.pl ( dir ) ( start index ) ( max results ) ' ( query ) ' 
^ The results are written into the directory ( dir ) ( must not exist ) as 
^ * .html ( &NUM , &NUM , etc. ) up to max results . 
^ ( query ) is a standard &NAME query ( as you would type in the web page ) , including file type restrictions . 
^ So to run &NAME 's &NAME example : 
^ google.pl jfk &NUM &NUM ' &NAME &NAME &NAME killed filetype : pdf OR fileteyp : ps ' 
^ &WEBSITE with the query , and retrieve the first &NUM documents from the google cache as &NAME , 
^ &NUM html , etc. ( See /homes / ekh29 / google / jfk for this result ) . 
^ A student should have no trouble using this script ( or &NUM of their own ) in their project . 
^ If there are any problems just let me know . 
^ eh 
^ &NAME : I have embedded a personal &NAME registration key in the script . 
^ This will eventually need to be changed .

^ &NAME : The Theory of &NAME : A Review 
^ Some time ago , &NAME &NAME obtained a remarkable result in computational learning theory : that ' weak ' classifiers can be ' boosted ' using a suitable algorithm such that a properly constructed combination of weak classifiers provides better performance than might be expected . 
^ Since this foundational result appeared applicable versions of the algorithm , and in particular the &NAME algorithm , have been used in many real problems , often with considerable success . 
^ In particular they have been demonstrated in many cases to exhibit a remarkable resistance to the usual ' overfitting ' problem in machine learning . 
^ In an attempt to explain this useful behaviour , and to better understand it , several theoretical frameworks have been proposed for the analysis of boosting algorithms , and the field is ripe for further study . 
^ This talk introduces boosting and reviews some of the theory that has appeared .

^ TITLE : Automated Application-level Checkpointing of &NAME Programs 
^ Recent trends in supercomputing are leading us towards &NUM new types of supercomputing platforms : large arrays of commodity parts and grid computing . 
^ While both platforms promise to be more cost effective than their monolithic predecessors , they suffer from increased failure rates ( as high as one failed processor a day ) due their size and the fact that they are not manufactured by a single entity . 
^ At the same time many computational tasks like protein folding and materials science simulations are becoming larger , taking weeks , months or even a year to compute . 
^ In short , program runtimes are greatly exceeding the meantime to failure of their platforms . 
^ Our work deals with automatic methods for enabling applications to survive hardware faults . 
^ We have developed a way of recording program state at the application-level by using a preprocessor to get the program save its own state . 
^ Furthermore , we have developed and implemented a distributed coordination protocol that arranges checkpoints from individual processors into a consistent global recovery line . 
^ When any processors fail , everybody else can roll back to their most recent checkpoint and resume their computation , with very little work lost .

^ Are your prelim results for a &NAME classifier using bag of words ' ? 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ The classification technique is based on language modelling , derived from speech recognition and something conceptually similar to the H+V model from my essay . 
^ At the moment I 'm only using a unigram LM though , so it boils down to something quite similar to &NAME bag-of-words . 
^ A more interesting result should be obtained when I take the subject into account , as it seems that most of the misclassified spam messages had empty message bodies ( with possible attachments ) , and therefore the classifier had nothing to go on .

^ OK & thanks . 
^ &NAME has a scheme for ' visiting scholars ' where a Trinity fellow can apply to have somebody who will be visiting &NAME to work with them put in this category for a 6-month or 1-year period ( with a slightly lighter-weight arrangement for short visits ) . 
^ The College gives itself a limited number of places for such visitors , and considers applications about once a term , usually around &NUM months ahead of the visit . 
^ It can also give just dining rights - but this is typically for people such as external directors of studies or others who are in some immediate and current way much more directly involved with &NAME than I can see how to make case for here . 
^ I do not know of any general scheme that is used to enhance the existing dining rights all our MAs get when a previous student is back in &NAME working in a department , on the Science Park or in another research lab . 
^ The indefinite stay is &NUM issue there , and the expectation that the best social context for a visitor should be close to the people they will be working with rather than with a college they were an undergraduate at will be another . 
^ &NAME 's c.v. suggests he is a pretty-well exact contemporary of me ... 
^ but again I do not think that gives me enough leverage to make a good case on his behalf - sorry .

^ I have been so madly busy with my work lately that I have n't even made it to the department more than &NUM times a week , and therefore have n't seen you much ( bantu has been in constant heavy use though ... ) . 
^ We 'll hopefully see soon , but to give you an update , I have gathered various things in this email . 
^ It ended up rather long , so perhaps better to sit back and have a cup of coffee before starting to read :- ) . 
^ &NAME 
^ &NUM ) The WSD-subcat experiments with &NAME 
^ Things are progressing as planned at that front . 
^ I should be done with my software and manual analysis of test verbs by mid December , and &NAME should have her &NAME system ready by then . 
^ We will run the first experiment then and see if &NAME needs to improve her &NAME system further . 
^ If a second experiment is needed , we will run it in early January . 
^ The &NAME main session deadline is in the end of &NAME , so if there are problems , we should have enough time to come up with solutions . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME task proposal for Senseval-3 
^ &NAME and I submitted a proposal to Senseval-3 last month . 
^ We will learn if the proposal is accepted within a couple of weeks now . 
^ If it is , and if we get reasonable results from our experiment , we will write some software and go ahead with the task . 
^ A footnote : The more I look into this &NAME issue , the more I realise why the baseline first sense heuristic method works as well as it does with the current approach to subcat . 
^ It 's because verbs tend to be polysemic in a 'systematic ' manner so that they often share more than just their first senses . 
^ I have n't yet had the chance to read linguistic literature about this or do experiments to examine the issue more closely , but I noticed this tendency when searching for suitable test verbs for our &NAME experiment . 
^ I would n't conclude that &NAME is useless , but it 's useful for a restricted set of ' idiosyncratic ' verbs only : those verbs whose high frequency senses differ from each other in an unsystematic or unpredictable way ( such as ' bear ' , 'strike ' , ' concentrate ' etc. ) . 
^ Many of these are high frequency verbs , though , and used frequently in their second and third senses as well . 
^ &NUM ) Work on semantic classes & manual analysis for back-off estimates 
^ This work is tedious but it 's progressing steadily , so I am not worried . 
^ I should be finished with it in time to submit some paper to the &NAME main session . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME linking / classification algorithm 
^ After I have my classification ready I will run some clustering experiments . 
^ I invited &NAME &NAME im &NAME here , but regrettably she ca n't make it before March . 
^ It 's ok : I just wanted to talk with her , but do n't actually need her help . 
^ &NAME &NAME 's group suggested me some effective clustering algorithms which have n't been used for clustering subcat distributions before . 
^ They gave me free software , so I will start with that . 
^ I wo n't waste much time on this if it does n't work with relatively good accuracy : extending the &NAME linking is doable & wo n't be a big task with &NAME 's new resource around . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME experiment with &NAME 
^ &NAME has started to extract multiword expressions from parsed data and wants to run a joint experiment with me to see if separating &NAME from simplex &NAME entries will improve subcat acquisition . 
^ I am quite interested in this as well , since &NAME involving &NAME perform especially badly . 
^ We will run a quick experiment together and if the results are promising , we will write it up and submit a paper to &NAME . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME workshop 
^ &NAME , &NAME and I have submitted a joint workshop proposal to &NAME . 
^ The workshop is on multiword analysis , acquisition and treatment , but we have given special emphasis on problems &NAME cause for real world tasks such as parsing and &NAME , to make sure it 's relevant for RASP and Meaning . 
^ &NAME has arranged &NAME &NAME from &NAME to join us in organization , so we 'll hopefully get some financial support . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME 
^ You asked me earlier to investigate the utility of FrameNet . 
^ The resource is quite impressive : their frames indicate semantic roles ( agent , theme , etc. ) and include useful corpus examples where these roles are marked as they occur in different subcat frames . 
^ The frames themselves differ from ours e.g. in parameterizing for prepositions . 
^ Such fine grained frames match obviously better with &NAME 's frames , but I would need to change and refine my approach quite a bit to benefit from that level of detail , i.e refine the subcat classification , split &NAME 's broad classes to fine-grained classes , obtain sense specific back-off stimates and so forth . 
^ I 'm afraid there is not enough time to do all that before my contract ends . 
^ And the practical problem for RASP is that FrameNet is not free for commercial purposes : 
^ ' We try to make the data produced by the project available to those who need it . 
^ Our policy is that the data should be provided free of charge for non-commercial , research and educational use . 
^ Those who are interested in using our data commercially or for profit will be expected to provide support for the work of the project . 
^ If you are interested downloading the FrameNet data , please send an e-mail giving your name , institutional affiliation ( such as university , for-profit company , non-profit research institute , government , etc. ) , and a general description of how you would like to use the data ( e.g. developing a lexicon for machine translation , writing a learners ' dictionary , teaching a course on semantics , etc. ) to &NUM of the following people : 
^ * &NAME &CHAR &NAME , Principal Investigator , &EMAIL 
^ * &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME Manager &EMAIL ' 
^ &SMILEY &NAME proposal 
^ &NAME and I have been working on the &NAME &NAME proposal and aim to submit it before &NAME . 
^ I will email or talk to you about that very soon . 
^ I was going to apply for the &NAME advanced fellowship as well , but I found out I am not eligible for it unless I have completed &NUM years of postdoctoral research . 
^ I did n't take this &NUM year thing seriously until I heard from &NAME that it 's really a strict rule and they are unlikely to even consider my application . 
^ I can apply for the fellowship next year this time , but it wo n't help me to find a job from Oct' &NUM on . 
^ &NAME has postdoctoral fellowships as well and I am eligible for those , so perhaps I should try them ? 
^ People keep on advising me to apply for the college fellowships , but I think that 's time wasted : there are around &NUM applications per fellowship .

^ TITLE : On Motion Interpolation for Image &NAME &NAME Building in &NAME 
^ There are many applications that call for a tool to create new pictures in a video stream . 
^ In video transmitted over wireless , whole pictures or a few blocks can be lost due to the low bandwidth and high error rates of those types of channels . 
^ Picture rebuilding at the receiver is therefore a useful remedy there and in the compression community this is called * Error Concealment * . 
^ In standards conversion for the broadcast television industry new frames need to be built for converting from &NUM fps to &NUM or &NUM fps for instance . 
^ In film post-production and special effects the task of removing objects from a sequence of frames is a well known activity and is undertaken at the moment by a combination of clever manual picture manipulation tools . 
^ An interesting development in &NUM Television and more recently * &NAME * effects , is the problem of viewpoint interpolation . 
^ This requires building new pictures from 
^ * virtual * camera viewpoints . 
^ This talk considers the unification of the solution to these problems under the guise of * Motion Interpolation * . 
^ The task is to build a motion field for picture data which does not exist , by interpolating from motion fields in future and past frames . 
^ &CHAR &NAME approach utilising spatio-temporal &NAME is used and the talk considers a practical solution to the massive combinatorial problem that typically results . 
^ Results from object removal in a video stream are shown .

^ Hi , 
^ Very brief description : 
^ I 've diverted a bit from my work plan because of this extra work entailed in examining the corpus so I have n't gone very far with the plan I wrote . 
^ I feel happy with this because I think there is less work involved in designing a kernel method than I had anticipated , since there are several 'ready-made ' kernel functions that may work suitably , whereas I had assumed I had to roll my own . 
^ I 've finished the script that runs the tokeniser and tagger , and am currently tagging my small corpus right now - it takes a long time but should finish ( hopefully ) by tomorrow morning . 
^ I have scripts that can parse the tagged output and give corpus term statistics for specific category codes , and I 'm working on a script that implements some of the ideas in the ' &NAME Corpora ' paper you pointed me to . 
^ I 've also started investigating &NAME , in preparation for building a classifier . 
^ I have a ( basic ) skeleton of the report , essentially very broad section headings , and have tried to sketch in some of the detail of a lit . 
^ review . 
^ I will upload my code to a readable directory when it 's available - running the tagger code on my computer renders it non-interactive , so I ca n't get to it to ftp . 
^ I should be keeping a backup copy on the department 's machines for situations like this .

^ I have checked with &NAME Friday , see below . 
^ It looks like we dont have to worry about individual externals , but we do have to avoid using the supervisor as dissertation examiner . 
^ This might be logistically quite tough to achieve . 
^ The only upside is that if you supervise lots of theses , you probably reduce your thesis examining load . 
^ &NAME 
^ Dear &NAME 
^ Yes , I know . 
^ We have no option ( &NAME and other pressures ) . 
^ Having no external for a degree is now completely out of the question . 
^ It does NOT however apply to the dissertation carried out as part of an &NAME programme for which there is an overall External Examiner for the cohort - that Examiner is sufficient to ring the &NAME &NAME . 
^ However , it is also pretty clear that neither of the dissertation examiners should be the supervisor . 
^ There has been consultation going on with Degree Committees over the pst &NUM years about examinations for the &NAME and the matter of externality has been central to these discussions . 
^ Not all Degree Committees agreed with the above position , but most have agreed there is nothing for it but to do it . 
^ &NAME should have the consultative documents the Degree Committees have been discussing ( since &NAME &NUM ) , but I can send you copies if you wish . 
^ All the best 
^ &NAME 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ I do n't believe the degree committee has received such a letter yet ( we had a meeting this afternoon and it was n't mentioned ) , but I think the relevant Board meeting happened quite recently . 
^ I will try and find out what 's actually been minuted - we will probably have to do something about it eventually .

^ &NAME , 
^ For what it 's worth , &NAME &NUM could be 'stated ' , ' explicit ' , or ( not my favorite ) ' parsed ' relationships . 
^ In &NAME &NUM , the relations are ' inferred ' . 
^ Seems like a potential segue to attributed relationships and ' who thinks what about whom ' analysis . 
^ Regards , &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME Director of Engineering , Core &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , Inc. &NUM &NAME Ave . , &NAME , CA &NUM 
^ In text mining , I find it useful to distinguish between these &NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities : 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text , e.g. 'Mrs . 
^ &NAME lives in &NAME . ' 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . 
^ For instance , Mrs. &NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in &NAME . 
^ The distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . 
^ Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun ' &NUM ' using the 'Sender : ' field of the email rather than a name in the text . 
^ In practice , however , I find the &NUM to be very different . 
^ In particular , &NAME &NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . 
^ One assumes the whole document is ' about ' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . 
^ In &NAME &NUM , however , you have to be much more serious about the &NAME , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you 're interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . 
^ Anyway , I 'm trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about &NAME &NUM vs. &NAME &NUM . 
^ 'Declarative ' vs. ' &NAME ' ? 
^ ' Third person vs. First person ' ? 
^ Any suggestions ? 
^ Cheers , &NAME

^ &NAME - I took a quick look over the draft proposal - looks quite nice . 
^ Sorry but not surprised to hear you have n't found better spam collections . 
^ Perhaps we need a distributed network of people who have their own confidential ham vs. spam collections ( as I , and I gather you , have ) and would could run software locally to test it . 
^ A few comments : 
^ --I did n't see ' &NAME ' defined anywhere . 
^ From context I think it 's ' grammatical relation ' but that took a while . 
^ --I would have liked to see a stronger case that syntactic relations are necessary for the particular classification problem of spam . 
^ Perhaps talk about someone whose legit mail contains the word &NAME a lot , but needs to distinguish that from spam uses . 
^ --In &NUM there 's a &NAME to me using the &NAME algorithm , which I have n't actually done , though I uses the closely related &NAME algorithm . 
^ &NAME &NAME has used &NAME . 
^ Best wishes with it ! 
^ I had a question if you have a moment : any suggestions on what companies have the most solid information extraction software ? 
^ ( Recognizing that 'solid ' and ' &NAME software ' is not a high probability collocation . ) A client asked me to pull together such a list . 
^ Regards , &NAME 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Thought you might like to see the penultimate draft of the text categorisation proposal we discussed when you visited . 
^ I looked at a lot of ML-inspired anti-spam filters and the consensus amongst developers is that &NAME is best , but bottom-line is &NUM knows as &NUM has ( developed ) a serious training and test dataset . 
^ There are various urls sprinkled thru' out the proposal , comments very welcome , as is passing on any info of interest re : spam filtering gleaned ( though not the whole proposal , please ! )

^ &NAME , 
^ It occurs to me that it is actually quite important to balance the size of the test sets when gathering results . 
^ For example , if you have a very large test set of spam messages , and a relatively small test set of genuine messages , then you are likely to get an artificially low precision for genuine message classification ( due to the small amount of potential genuine positive classifications ) , and an artificially high precision for spam classification ( due to the small amount of potential spam misclassifications ) . 
^ This is an issue for the lingspam testset , where there a far more genuine messages than spam in each test set , making the genuine precision artificially higher than the spam precision . 
^ Weighting could then be taken into account after the test sets have been balanced . 
^ Does this sound reasonable ?

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I 'm finally nearly through editing the manuscript for the Language Evolution book . 
^ I have a few queries about references in your chapter : 
^ - do you have the reference for French and &NAME &NUM 
^ - on page &NUM , you refer to ' &NAME &NUM ' a couple of times . 
^ Should this be &NUM or &NUM ? 
^ - could you provide an up-to-date reference for ' &NAME &NUM / in press ' ( e.g. submitted to &NAME 's volume , or appearing in the abstracts book , or something ? ) 
^ Thanks in advance ! 
^ best , Si

^ Dear all , 
^ Where are we on this now ? 
^ I thought we were waiting for an answer from &NAME / &NAME to &NAME 's e-mail below and to mine of 26th March ? 
^ Regards 
^ &NAME 
^ Dear all 
^ Thanks for that . 
^ Yes I 'm feeling much better now , thanks . 
^ I have &NUM points resulting from a brief conversation with &NAME : 
^ &NUM . 
^ will &NAME &NAME be a founder 
^ &NUM , This is important with respect to tax . 
^ Would the shares be deemed to 
^ have been issued later with a &NAME liability ? 
^ The precise time of the issue of shares to &NAME &NAME is critical and if the issue is post-money , the valuation could leave us with a &NAME liability . 
^ &NUM . 
^ would a side agrement and no &CHAR / &CHAR agreement until funding is raised be constitutional ? 
^ I 've not dealt with a case like the one proposed and wonder whether the savings in not duplicating the work of &NUM &CHAR / hs agreements ( pre-money and post-money ) is not outweighed by the sort of issues indicated above . 
^ Having a simple &CHAR / &CHAR agreement from the outset should n't be too expensive in time or money ? 
^ Best regards

^ In my view , there are &NUM unfortunate aspects of the discussion of the &NAME &NAME case , both on this list and elsewhere . 
^ The first is that it has become something of a focal point in the discussion of a possible academic boycott against &NAME . 
^ But such a boycott can be carried out at varies levels . 
^ At present , there is a de facto informal boycott : very few European academics visit &NAME . 
^ Then there is the option of a boycott at the institutional level : European institutions ( e.g. grant-giving bodies ) sever links with &NAME academic institutions . 
^ Finally , there is the option of a boycott at the personal level : individual academics sever links with academics employed at &NAME universities . 
^ The &NAME &NAME case has been used in various statements to implicitly equate an academic boycott with a boycott at the personal level . 
^ But this presents a false choice . 
^ It is perfectly coherent to be in favour of a boycott at the institutional level and to oppose a boycott at the personal level . 
^ The second unfortunate aspect of the discussion about &NAME &NAME is that there is a tendency to confuse support for her right to engage in political action with support for that action . 
^ The essence of the right to engage in political action is that such action is granted even if the majority disagree with the opinion expressed . 
^ Therefore , it is perfectly coherent to oppose any disciplinary action against &NAME &NAME by &NAME and at the same time to oppose the academic boycott . 
^ &NUM rejoinder to this is that &NAME &NAME 's actions are discriminatory ( or even racist ) in that they are targeted at academics employed at &NAME universities . 
^ But academics employed at &NAME universities do not form an ethnic group , do not share a particular sexual orientation , etc. A personal academic boycott would apply , for example , to Americans employed at &NAME universities , but not to &NAME employed at American universities . 
^ One may call this discrimination , but only if the meaning of the term is extended beyond what it is commonly understood to mean . 
^ To discriminate , in the intended sense , is to make a distinction between people on the basis of irrelevant properties , e.g. turning someone down for a lectureship because she is female . 
^ To be affiliated with an &NAME institution may be seen as potentially relevant in the context of possible boycotts against &NAME , quite apart from the question whether such a boycott is justified . 
^ Another rejoinder is that an academic boycott at any level is discriminatory , because &NUM has proposed an academic boycott against other countries whose politics are unacceptable ( see &NAME & &NAME 's letter in yesterday 's &NAME ) . 
^ This comes down to saying that it is discriminatory to try and do something about &NUM evil unless one does something about all evils . 
^ Again , this may be called discrimination , but only if the meaning of the term is extended . 
^ There are other concepts that have been stretched in this discussion ( human rights , academic freedom , etc. ) . 
^ But that is not the point I wanted to make . 
^ The point I wanted to make is that we should not let such matters keep us from discussing the heart of the matter , the arguments for and against an academic boycott against &NAME . 
^ I therefore do not agree with &NAME &NAME suggestion that academic practice should be completely divorced from politics , no matter what the circumstances , and that an academic boycott is hence something that should not be debated by institutions like the &NAME . 
^ I think we all have the intellectual responsibility to debate exactly these issues .

^ How about if you guys pay for flying us back next christmas ( &NUM adults , &NUM children , tourist class , 30-day advance purchase tickets ) to put things in order , and you can stay in our house during your sabbatical . 
^ Your only further expense would be the cost of utilities while you are there .

^ Rent for our house ( or comparable ) would ( I think ) typically be $ &NUM or more per month .

^ ( confidential comments ) 
^ Technically this paper is fine , and I think it is worth publishing , even if the headline experimental results are not particularly good - but language model improvements are notorious for the problems in translating them to &NAME reductions . 
^ But the lack of citation to other work seems part of a depressing trend , and I think that it is extremely important that authors properly cite previous work . 
^ ( comments to authors ) 
^ This paper is concerned with updating a language model for broadcast news over time , using daily newswire and newspaper text as updated training data . 
^ The main contributions of the paper are a method for interpolating a language model constructed from recent data with pre-exisiting background &NAME , and a method of lexicon extension aimed at reducing the &NAME rate . 
^ The presented experiments aim to assess the effects of lexicon extension in terms of &NAME rate , perplexity and speech recognition &NAME . 
^ The final result gives a &NUM reduction in perplexity , but a much more modest &NUM reduction in &NAME . 
^ This is usually the case for language model improvements . 
^ Overall , I think that the paper presents a reasonable approach to the problem . 
^ The method is clearly presented and the experiments are interesting , although the experimental results do not give strong support for the method . 
^ I think the paper is acceptable for publication given the changes referred to below . 
^ The principal drawback with the paper as presented is that the authors do not provude much context to other work , and there a lot of relevant work is not cited . 
^ * Language model adaptation , in particular mixture-based methods . 
^ &NUM example citations ( there are many others ) : &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ ' On the Dynamic Adaptation of Stochastic Language Models ' . 
^ &NAME &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ ' Language Model Adaptation Using Mixtures and an Exponentially Decaying Cache ' , &NAME . 
^ * Lexical adaptation over time . 
^ The only cited work is the cache model of &NAME and &NAME . 
^ However over the past decade there have been some interesting explicit models of word rate , which should be referred to , for example : &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) , ' &NAME mixtures ' , Natural Language Engineering , &NUM ( &NUM ) , &NUM . 
^ &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ 'Distribution of content words and phrases in text and language modelling ' , Natural Language Engineering , &NUM ( &NUM ) , &NUM . 
^ &NAME and Renals ( &NUM ) . 
^ ' Variable word rate n-grams ' , &NAME . 
^ &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ ' Bursty and hierarchical structure in streams ' , Proc . 
^ 8th &NAME &NAME . 
^ * Methods for &NAME reduction . 
^ There have been several papers in this area over the past decade ( eg several recent papers on using &NAME systems lexicon extension / tuning ) , and I think it would be appropriate to refer to some of this work . 
^ The paper would benefit if it was possible for a native English speaker to proofread it . 
^ &NUM other minor point : on &NAME &NAME seems to be a very high threshold .

^ paragraph{Robust &NAME of Text} 
^ The &NAME and RASP systems are distributed under research and commercial licensing arrangements set up originally under the &NAME Programmefootnote{See {tt &WEBSITE and tt &WEBSITE other sites world-wide currently hold licences , where the systems have been used for teaching , research on grammar development and on parsing ( e.g. &NAME etal , &NUM ; &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME &NAME , &NUM ) , for software requirements specification in ( restricted ) &NAME ( &NAME and MacNish , &NUM ; &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) , for spoken dialogue understanding ( &NAME , &NUM ) , for information extraction from biomedical databases ( &NAME etal , &NUM ; &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME and Lascarides , &NUM ; &NAME etal , in press ) , for error-correcting parsing as a component of an automated editor 's assistant ( &NAME , &NUM ) , for parsing patient medical records ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , for text simplification ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , and in many other projects . 
^ The &NAME grammar formalism is flexible and supports a wide-range of theories and analyses within the unification~ / constraint~ / feature-based approaches . 
^ About a dozen grammars have been developed in the formalism for teaching and research purposes , incorporating analyses drawn from &NAME , &NAME and Categorial Grammar . 
^ The &NAME full grammar has been ported , via a completely automatic procedure , to the &NAME ( &NAME , &NUM , &NAME , &NUM ) and &NAME ( &NAME &NAME , &NUM ) systems , demonstrating the intertranslatability and reusability of &NAME grammars and parsers . 
^ The system is integrated with GATE ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , facilitating &CHAR / &CHAR standardisation and rapid prototyping of &NAME systems . 
^ It is also integrated with the &NAME &NAME system ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) allowing analysis of text tokenised and marked up using &NAME and now supporting &NAME output in a variety of formats ( see below for details ) . 
^ The RASP ( robust accurate statistical parsing ) system is constructed from the &NAME system with additional components for part-of-speech tagging , lemmatisation and statistical parse ranking . 
^ The first public release of the RASP system was made in December , &NUM , and is free for non-commercial use . 
^ RASP supports plug-and-play ' robust parsing of arbitrary English text with state-of-the-art levels of accuracy and greater depth of analysis than is possible using extant deterministic finite-state partial parsers or even treebank based statistical parsing systems ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ The RASP system uses a probabilistic generalized &NAME parser ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME etal , &NUM ) to output the {it n}-best analyses with an average throughput of &NUM words / sec on standard hardware and has , so far , been used to parse about &NUM million words of English ( including the British National Corpus ( &NAME , &NUM ) , &NAME Corpus ( &NAME , &NUM ) , &NAME Corpus ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) the &NAME &NAME track top ranked documents database ( &NAME , &NUM ) , and parts of the &NAME &NAME database ( &NAME etal , in press ) . 
^ The ongoing RASP project ( &NAME reference &NUM ) provides support for further development of the RASP system and its application to the problem of acquiring richer lexicons of English . 
^ A second release of the RASP system is scheduled for late &NUM , when this project ends . 
^ paragraph{Classification and &NAME Learning} 
^ Previous research by &NAME on foundational issues in machine learning has addressed structure selection for a class of neural networks ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) and the investigation of the learning curves for a related class of networks using both computational learning theory ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) and statistical physics ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) ; the investigation of the extent to which learning-theoretic results might be directly applicable in practice ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) ; and the analysis of the sample complexity of the cross-validation estimate ( &NAME &NUM ; &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ In addition , applied research has addressed the way in which the strength of the underlying learner affects boosting algorithms ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) and the application of support vector machines to drug design ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) . 
^ By better understanding the principles on which machine learning is based , it is hoped that new techniques , improving significantly on those that already exist , can be developed and applied . 
^ There is good evidence , for example in recent work in computational learning theory , that an understanding of such theory does in fact lead to this kind of development . 
^ Excellent examples are boosting techniques for supervised learners , and support vector machines . 
^ Text classification is an application area where many of these insights have not as yet been thoroughly explored .

^ subsection{Background} 
^ Text classification is the task of classifying ( partially ) textual documents according to a predefined set of class labels . 
^ Frequently , text classification is framed as a supervised or semi-supervised machine learning problem in which a training set of prelabelled documents is provided and the task is to train a classifier able to categorise subsequent unlabelled documents &NAME earlier technology based on hand-crafted domain- and application-specific rules was also deployed by industry . 
^ However , since the academic and industry consensus is that such systems have been surpassed by those based on machine learning techniques ( e.g. &NAME , &NUM ) , they will not be considered further here.} Classification can be in terms of language ( &NAME , &NUM ) , genre ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , sentiment ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , usefulness ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , or topic ( &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ The latter is most common and often text classification is used as a synonym for topic classification ( e.g. &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ Topic classification is relevant to development of web portals ( &WEBSITE ) , news feed filtering and summarisation systemsfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE system managementfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE indeed any situation where unstructured databases of documents containing some text need to be classified or structured hierarchically to facilitate search and retrieval . 
^ It is well known that the rate of growth of machine-readable unstructured text is increasing , along with the time spent by knowledge workers ' attempting to access relevant information . 
^ Therefore automated topic classification is seen as a key tool within the broad area of information and knowledge management . 
^ There are many companies which provide services supporting improved retrieval of documents over standard keyword-based search tools.footnote{For example , &NAME , probabilistic or vector based document retrieval systems or web search engines and associated techniques such as &NAME -- see e.g. &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) for an overview.} For example , &NAME Business Briefingfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE preclassified financial and business news feeds , and &NAME Lightfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE &NUM sources of preclassified feeds from diverse media . 
^ Such companies usually utilise a mixture of automated and manual processes to classify documents to achieve a level of performance justifying subscription chargesfootnote{See e.g. {tt &WEBSITE paper : {it The Value of Indexing}} . 
^ A number of machine learning classification techniques have been deployed with reasonable success for topic classification , such as &NAME &NAME ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) , &NAME &NAME and &NAME ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) and Support Vector Machines ( &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ The vast majority employ a feature-set of contentful word forms or stems ( usually called terms ) derived from the training data to classify unlabelled documents according to the similarity of these terms to the composite representations constructed for each predefined class . 
^ Academic work in this area has been intense recently , with associated &NAME text classification and filtering &WEBSITE / pubs.html} organised regularly in the &NAME . 
^ These have established common test sets and evaluation measures for topic classification and filtering within the academic community which provide objective and clear targets against which improvement can be measured , as well as ongoing competitions to participate in. There are also companies offering automated solutions to topic classification of , for example , company intranets , such as Autonomyfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE products differ in terms of targeted vertical market and the specific application ( and thus operational setting and user interface ) , they all utilise similar underlying public-domain technology based on the family of techniques referenced above . 
^ Although classification into broad topics , such as sport ' versus business ' , can be done very accurately with extant automated techniques given enough prelabelled data , there are many critical and commercially important areas of text classification that would benefit from improved performance . 
^ Fine-grained classes , such as &NAME markets ' versus equity markets ' are often difficult to distinguish reliably using pure term-based systems , and classes with small amounts of training data present challenges for supervised learning methods . 
^ For example , &NAME etal , ( in press ) report accuracy rates ( &CHAR $ _{1} $ ) varying from &NUM down to &NUM for term-based classification of &NAME &NAME documents into &NUM &NAME ' topic classes . 
^ Examination of the lower accuracy classes reveals that fine-grainedness of the classes and / or relatively small amounts of training data are the &NUM main factors . 
^ When we move beyond topic classification , the limitations of a pure term-based approach become more apparent . 
^ Genre and sentiment classification both require access to phrasal and grammatical information which is not inherent in individual words but only manifest in their combination , grammatical type , and higher level organisation ( e.g. &NAME etal , &NUM ; &NAME etal , &NUM ) . 
^ For instance , the scientific genre is characterised by greater use of constructions like passive , a higher proportion of deverbal nominalisations like {it solidification} , whilst sentiment is best captured via recognition of grammatically flexible phrases , such as {it ( very much ) do / did not ( at all ) like X} . 
^ Increasingly text is available in semi-structured form such as &NAME or &NAME , where , for example , document titles , authors , dates , citations and so &NAME can be easily identified , but the main text remains unstructured . 
^ Term-based systems cannot exploit this level of structure as the representation of a document is a bag of words ' . 
^ However , some work has effectively exploited such structure , for example , to classify scientific papers into topic hierarchies and build citation indexes , integrating positional information into term-based weighting schemes ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) . 
^ Finally , the standard definition of the text classification task does not lend itself well to applications where adaptation is important , for example in a news feeding system where users can provide relevance feedback , by accepting or rejecting documents proposed by a system , the classes of interest need to adapt over time with the users ' interests . 
^ Junk email filteringfootnote{The definiton of junk or spam varies . 
^ However , for our purposes , email that the user did not request and / or want will suffice.} is an application which exhibits many of the properties that make pure term-based classification less effective . 
^ The definition of junk changes over time ( e.g. {it Viagra} is a highly discriminatory term now but was n't &NUM years ago ) and from user to user ( {it Viagra} still being just about on the junk list for the older proposer ) , whilst junk senders modify messages to bypass rule-based server-side filtering systems , therefore adaptiveness is essential . 
^ Email messages are semi-structured with sender , subject , and date fields but with the main body of text unstructured . 
^ The effective recognition of junk involves a mixture of topic and genre classification , since there are strong stylistic features , such as emphatic expressions or deceptive formatting ( {it LOADS of MONEY!!!} , {it &NAME iagra} ) and phrasal features are much more discriminatory than individual terms alone ( e.g. {it buy ( as much ) &NAME ( as you want)} ) because frequently the relationship to non-junk topics is fine-grained ( e.g. pharmeceutical research and marketing documents may contain {it Viagra} ) . 
^ For this reason , most extant junk email filtering systems deployed on both server and client side systems are largely &NAME , {tt &WEBSITE for details of extant filtering tools} . 
^ More efficient and effective filtering of junk email is becoming a critical requirement since extant server-side techniques employed by businesses and &NAME frequently reject non-junk email , do not detect a significant amount of junk , are not easily adaptable to changes in junk as rules are mostly manually-specified patterns , and are not adaptable at all to differing user requirements ( e.g. &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ Thus , the overall volume of junk email is growing as is the average proportion of junk in individuals ' email boxes ( currently &NUM and &NUM respectively , with a &NUM increase in &NUM according to &NAME ) . 
^ Some junk filters have been built using supervised &NAME &NAME classifiers ( e.g. &NAME etal , &NUM ; &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ These systems have often made domain specific use of email structure , as well as phrasal and genre based features indicative of junk . 
^ However , such features have either been defined heuristically and manually , or by creating very large feature sets ( approx . 
^ $ &CHAR 
^{n} $ ) over all possible {it n}-grams of contiguous terms from the set of terms , $ &CHAR $ , in the training data . 
^ Despite the availability of large datasets of junk &NAME , training , testing and evaluation has been minimal and unstandardised . 
^ These prototypes potentially suffer from the problem of sparse training data because of the large size of the potential feature set and / or high cost of development because of the need to manually develop new phrasal / genre features as junk email adapts to extant deployed filters . 
^ They also do not incorporate theoretically-motivated and thus provably optimal methods for combining evidence from overlapping and thus highly dependent sets of features . 
^ The RASP system supports the structuring of raw text drawn from arbitrary domains ( with or without additional information in the form of metadata or semi-structured input ) into a several different formats that can be used as an initial representation from which classifier features can be acquired . 
^ The system retains positional and structural information in the form of &NAME markup of section and paragraph boundaries , and so &NAME , and parses each text sentence to recover the grammatical relations between its constituent elementsfootnote{See {tt &WEBSITE appropriate representation for classification applications is likely to be sets of ( weighted ) grammatical relations ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) , as shown in Figure~ref{wgrs} . 
^ In Figure~ref{wgrs} , the highest-ranked direct object ( dobj ) of {it get} is {it Viagra} despite the textual separation caused by the equative {it as much &CHAR as} construction . 
^ begin{figure} {it You can now get as much &NAME as you want from the comfort of your home!} [ &NUMm ] Sample of highest-ranked consistent &NAME : begin{verbatim} ( |ncsubj | |get : &NAME | |You : &NAME | _ ) ( |dobj | |get : &NAME | |Viagra : &NAME | _ ) ( |ncsubj | |want : &NAME | |you : &NAME | _ ) end{verbatim}

^ &NAME uncover semantic associations between terms in the text and in the process implicitly resolve much lexical semantic ambiguity , as words occurring in specific combinations tend to be used with a predictable and restricted meaning ( e.g. {it bond} in {it bond markets} ) . 
^ They also allow classifier features to abstract away from the surface variation in text . 
^ Invariant phrasal ' features can be extracted from varying textual input over sequences of arbitrary length , such as the bond market ' represented by the &NAME ( ncmod _ / for market bond ) from : {it overseas bond markets} , or {it the market for junk bonds collapsed yesterday} . 
^ &NAME discriminatory relational features , such as order &NAME ' , will be represented by the &NAME , ( dobj order &NAME _ ) , regardless of whether the input text is : {it order as much &NAME as you want} , {it Loads of &NAME available to order cheap} , {it &NAME &NAME never easier} , etc. This represents a considerable potential improvement on either {it n}-gram or manually-defined features since there are many fewer GRs than {it n}-grams ( well below $ V 
^{2} $ ) , they generalise better across text , so will be much less sparse , and can be derived automatically . 
^ If training data contains : {it &NAME &NAME pills never easier} or {it Ordering packets of &NAME here} , then tractable inference over a chain of modifier and argument GRs can still be made -- ( dobj order pill / packet _ ) and ( ncmod _ / of pill / packet &NAME ) to form a single feature for classification , because a set of consistent GRs for a single sentence form a directed acyclic graph ( &NAME ) . 
^ On the other hand , input like : {it Users of &NAME bought $ 10M of the drug last year} or {it &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME will be bought by a wider range of customers than Viagra} will not result in a chain of &NAME linking buy ' to &NAME ' as direct object . 
^ Finally , there are alternative predicates to {it order} and {it get} such as {it buy} or {it try} , so automatic clustering of such predicates across ( related ) &NAME to form classifier features may also be effective , making the training data less sparse . 
^ This can be done using existing on-line public-domain lexical resources , such as WordNetfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE synonym sets ( e.g. Fukimoto and &NAME , &NUM ) , or using more domain specific automatic clustering over &NAME representations ( e.g. &NAME and Pantel , &NUM ) . 
^ The current RASP system has a combined precision and recall ( &CHAR $ _{1} $ -measure ) of nearly &NUM on the recovery of a single set of consistent GRs from its highest-ranked analysis of input ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ Weights on &NAME provide evidence for the reliability of specific GRs ( derived from the overall probability of and the proportion of analyses of the input which support them ) and therefore , enable precision / recall trade-offs in which &NAME below a certain threshold are judged too unreliable for classification , or weights could be factored into the classification process as weights on the associated classifier features . 
^ At &NUM precision , the system still has &NUM recall . 
^ &CHAR preliminary experiment to build a topic classifier for &NAME &NAME , using RASP GRs as the document representation , achieved a &NUM improvement in classification accuracy on fine-grained &NAME classes , than a pure term-based system using the same number of features ( &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ The optimal system utilising GRs is likely to include some limited inference from chains of &NAME during feature detection and selection , will factor in &NAME weights , will mix term-based and GR-based features , and may also need to be sensitive to wider positional and structural information , as well as lexical semantic clusters of terms . 
^ However , our main hypothesis is that the output of RASP is linguistically-motivated , reliable and accurate enough to allow construction of better text classifiers than is possible using shallower and / or less accurate methods for extraction of phrasal ' / {it n}-gram features ( e.g. &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ To our knowledge , there has been no attempt , to date , to use features of the kind proposed -- that is , ranked &NAME -- in a principled manner , with the aim of improving classification . 
^ Probabilistic techniques like &NAME &NAME have the advantage that statistically-motivated approaches can be taken to weighting and thresholding , as well as to weight integration from the RASP system and the classifier . 
^ Although &NAME &NAME is outperformed by other classifiers , there are techniques among the current state-of-the-art that share this advantage . 
^ For example , whilst &NAME are marginally more successful on pure term-based topic classification and are known to handle high-dimensional feature sets well , recent developments such as the &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) outperform them and combine the advantages of probabilistic interpretation with integrated feature selection . 
^ Similarly , regularized logistic regression has been demonstrated to provide equivalent performance to an &NAME while once again having the advantage that it provides a probability model ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ &NAME themselves can be considered through their connection to Gaussian processes in order to recover a probabilistic interpretation ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ subsection{Programme and Methodology} 
^ The goal of the proposed project is to develop generic automated techniques for document representation and effective feature selection over ( re ) structured document content , parsed with the RASP system , within an adaptive classification framework . 
^ Junk email filtering will be used as &NUM test case , as training and test data are available and because the application is important . 
^ &CHAR freely-distributed client-side email filtering system for &NAME platforms will be released at the end of the project . 
^ In addition , more standard topic classification experiments will be conducted on the &NAME &NAME data , and we will participate in a &NAME filtering or classification competition if one is run in &NUM / &NUM . 
^ subsubsection{Data Preparation} ( &NAME , &NAME &NUMths , &NAME &NUMths ) 
^ We will parse the &NAME &NAME dataset ensuring that all metadata is preserved in &NAME format and that a cleaned up classification of the documents is maintained , following the proposals in &NAME etal ( in press ) . 
^ This will allow us to conduct topic classification experiments using the dataset which is most likely to become the new standard of comparison for the academic community , and for which baseline results for many standard term-based classification techniques are already available ( &NAME , etal , in press ) . 
^ The dataset contains around &NAME stories and will require development of some specialised tokenisation and preprocessing tools and significant computational resources to parse and extract weighted &NAME . 
^ We will also parse and merge several existing corpora of anonymised email messages manually preclassified into junk and non-junkfootnote{See {tt &WEBSITE construct a more adequate dataset for experimentation containing a greater variety of time-stamped email sampled over a longer period of time than is available to date . 
^ This will be obtained from individual users ( such as &NAME , who has a substantial collection gathered over several years ) and extant public domain datasets . 
^ This will result in a more hetrogeneous corpus of non-junk than is currently available . 
^ subsubsection{Classification Techniques} ( &NAME &NUMths , &NAME &NUMths , &NAME , &NAME ) 
^ Initially , we will use existing implementations and toolkits for rapid prototyping to explore the viability of different techniques , such as BOWfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE / afs / cs / project / theo-11 / www / naive-bayes.html}} , WEKAfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE &WEBSITE/~danr /snow.html}} , BUGSfootnote{{tt &WEBSITE &NAME , augmented if necessary by a small degree of original implementation should suitable versions of algorithms of interest not be available . 
^ In a pure-term based system , feature selection is limited to removing non-discriminatory terms ( such as function words ) and to thresholding the feature set on the basis of document frequency , tf / idf , information gain , mutual information or some similar measure ( e.g. &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ However , the RASP system makes available a large variety of often highly-dependent feature types , such as &NAME with / without lemmatisation of content words , abstraction over &NAME type and contained terms , chaining of &NAME , extraction of phrasal features , mixing of positional and structural information such as degree of embedding of the &NAME in the input text , linear position in the sentence , section , paragraph and / or document , mixing of &NAME and pure terms , and so forth . 
^ We will explore the utility of different feature types by testing their discriminative value on training data and develop theoretically-motivated methods for representing mixtures of overlapping , highly-dependent ( potentially sparse ) feature types . 
^ In the context of probabilistic classification models which integrate feature selection , such as the &NAME , &NUM promising approach is smoothed ( e.g. back-off , &NAME , &NUM ) parameter estimation drawm from statistical language modelling , given the recent successes in information retrieval utilising language models ( &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ subsubsection{Implementation of Text Classifier System} ( &NAME &NUMths , &NAME , &NAME ) 
^ After the exploratory phase , a classification technique will be chosen and integrated with a suite of tools that allow specification of feature types , selection and weighting of discriminatory instances relative to training data , and optimisation of weights of mixtures of feature types . 
^ The implementation will aim to be as generic as possible to facilitate use with other classification tasks . 
^ However , its functionality will be guided by the experiments with the &NUM chosen applications . 
^ It is likely that a reimplementation of the chosen classification technique tightly integrated with the feature specification and selection tools will be more effective at this point than making use of an existing public domain toolset . 
^ The classifier is likely to be implemented in &CHAR ( ++ ) for efficient handling of sparse multidimensional feature representations . 
^ However , the full system will be based on a loosely coupled pipelined architecture ( implemented via &NAME tools and shell scripts ) , so that ongoing developments of and improvements to the RASP system can be easily integrated with the classifier . 
^ subsubsection{GR Inference and Transformation} ( &NAME &NUMths , &NAME ) 
^ Whilst it is possible to manually identify specific inferences and transformations of GRs that are likely to enhance identification of discriminatory classifier feature types , the general problem of manipulating &NAME of weighted GRs to automatically discover them is much more open-ended . 
^ The success of the project does not rest on development of a fully automated and generic framework for feature specification , detection and weighting for any classification task . 
^ Nevertheless , progress towards this goal would represent a significant contribution to enhanced generic text classification technology , capable of yielding accurate classifiers from labelled training data with minimal specialist effort . 
^ The &NAME representation of text encodes a proper subset of the logical form of a sentence , roughly encoding predicate-argument relations but underspecifying the scope of operators and quantifiers . 
^ In ongoing work with the RASP system , we have already begun to elucidate the relationship between &NAME sets and factored description logics used in &NAME , such as robust minimal recursion semantics ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) . 
^ Building on this work , the PhD student will develop graph-based transformations satisfying logical equivalence and entailment relations which can be used to automatically specify and detect a wider range of feature types and their instances in a theoretically-motivated fashion . 
^ To control the size of the resulting hypothesis space for feature selection , factors such as &NAME weights , likely discriminatory power over a document set , and so &NAME , will need to be integrated closely with the transformation process . 
^ Aggregation of &NAME into a single classifier feature on the basis of clustering or classification of words occuring in specified slots ( see section &NUM for examples ) will only be useful if it is done relative to the target classes to be discriminated . 
^ Therefore , a second line of inquiry will explore how GR-based techniques for clustering words and identifing word senses can be adapted to this task . 
^ Existing approaches which use WordNet synonym sets or clustering based on similar distribution in &NAME provide a promising starting point for such work , but it is an open question whether such techniques can be constrained and made task sensitive enough to be useful . 
^ subsubsection{Experimentation and Optimisation} ( &NAME &NUMths , &NAME &NUMths , &NAME , &NAME ) 
^ Once an initial implementation of the full system is available , extensive experimentation will be undertaken with both datasets to derive an optimal system , using standard evaluation measures , such as precision , recall and &CHAR $ _{beta} $ for topic classification ( e.g. &NAME , &NUM ) , and an additional cost measure for email filtering ( &NAME etal , &NUM ) . 
^ As well as comparing these results to extant results for the &NAME dataset using pure term-based classification , we will also construct term-based classifiers for both datasets to facilitate as direct comparison as possible in order to evaluate the contribution and utility of linguistic features . 
^ Since identification of optimal feature sets is complex , particularly when the space of possible feature types and the number of instances is large , we expect to devote a significant part of the project to experimental manipulation of the feature specification , selection and weighting parameters . 
^ We will also aim to participate in an upcoming &NAME topic classification or filtering competition with our system in order to make a wider comparison with other systems under development and to test performance in a different operational setting with either different data , different classes , or both . 
^ subsubsection{Email Filtering System} ( &NAME &NUMths , &NAME ) 
^ Development of an operational email filtering system from the protoptype above can be done fairly straightforwardly on &NAME platforms by calling the pretrained system ( e.g. via a CRON process ) on a user 's mail file ( .mail ) and classifying it into distinct inboxes ( +inbox and +junk ) . 
^ These can then be accessed via standard &NAME mail programs . 
^ The user will be able to set a precision / recall , false positive / negative trade-off and to refile misclassified messages . 
^ The system will retrain itself from users ' refiled inboxes at user-specified intervals , resulting in adaptation to users ' requirements . 
^ System executables and / or source code will be distributed free via the web under a non-commercial use licence similar to that used for the RASP system , encouraging user feedback and general dissemination of improvements . 
^ The parsed datasets use to develop the email filtering and topic classification systems will also be distributed to facilitate comparative work at the end of the project . 
^ It is likely that existing open source code will be utilised to provide the functionality to interpret different email formats and integrate with &WEBSITE / ) . 
^ subsubsection{Standards for Text Representation} ( &NAME &NUMths , &NAME ) 
^ It is important to relate ongoing standards-based work on text document representation such as &NAME &NAME specifications of the RASP GR-scheme ( &NAME and &NAME , &NUM ) and &NAME description format ( &NAME , &WEBSITE logical form , developed by the &NAME community , such as quasi logical forms ( &NAME , &NAME , &NUM ) or minimum recursion semantics ( &NAME , &NAME etal , &NUM ) to the feature specification system developed by this project . 
^ &CHAR clear statement of the relationships will ensure that the classifier system developed here will be usable with the output of other &NAME systems and wider web-based initiatives on document mark-up . 
^ To facilitate this , we will monitor ongoing standards-based efforts and write a report / user manual , documenting &NAME in the system and their relationship to such emerging standards . 
^ subsection{Relevance to Beneficiaries} label{benef} 
^ Increased performance in text classification systems will be of direct benefit to information and knowledge management . 
^ There is a substantial UK-based industry developing and deploying such technology , and wide uptake of it in the structuring of company intranets and textual databases . 
^ Such technology providers will be able to utilise our technology directly via licensing arrangements . 
^ More widely , availability of better text classification systems will feed into ongoing efforts to improve information access and management in many non-commercial contexts , such as web portals to classified scientific papers . 
^ Junk email filtering is a critical issue in its own right , with a recent marked increase in commercial solutions . 
^ We will provide a free tool for end users running unix systems , and licensable components for commercial exploitation . 
^ subsection{Dissemination and Exploitation} 
^ Results from the project will be published in international refereed journals ( e.g. {it Natural Language Engineering} , {it Artificial Intelligence} , {it &NAME Learning} ) and presented and published in international refereed conference proceedings and workshops ( e.g. Association for Computational Linguistics , &NAME Conference on &NAME &NAME , Knowledge Discovery and Data &NAME , &NAME &NAME Conference ) . 
^ These papers will also be made available via the Web through archives and project-specific Web pages at &NAME , where a short description of the project , links to publications , and on-line software demonstration / dissemination will be maintained . 
^ Building on experience gained from the distribution and licensing of the &NAME and RASP toolkits , we will offer a research or commercial licence agreement to all organisations and use any income from commercial licensing to provide a technical support and consultancy infrastructure for the user base . 
^ All collaborators and users will be encouraged to provide ongoing feedback which will guide further development . 
^ The software and datasets developed during the project will be distributed free via the web for non-commercial use ( not infringing existing copyright and the privacy of donators in the case of the databases ) . 
^ &NAME &NAME will be granted a non-exclusive right to commercially license the classification system , ensuring a clear route to commercial exploitation of the software . 
^ subsection{Justification of Resources} 
^ The project will require a postdoctoral &NAME , with good unix tools and general programming experience and a background in machine learning . 
^ In addition , a PhD student , ideally with a background in statistical &NAME , will undertake research on optimal linguistic representation of text for classification . 
^ Both &NAME ( PI1 ) and &NAME ( PI2 ) will contribute &NUM day / week to the project , but the workpart resources relate only to the &NAME and to the PhD student . 
^ The latter will contribute &NUM months directly to the project , &NUM months being reserved for background reading and writing up . 
^ We request funds for &NUM &NAME ( running &NAME / &NAME / &CHAR ( ++ ) ) with substantial memory and disc space ( due to the high computational and storage requirements for development of classifiers with high-dimensional feature sets over large datasets ) . 
^ Computing infrastructure / support is at standard departmental rates . 
^ Extra disc storage is needed to hold the large amount of parsed data . 
^ &NAME includes contributions to a &NAME site licence as the RASP system is implemented in &NAME . 
^ The travel budget requested will cover dissemination of project results at &NUM conferences ( &NUM &NAME , &NUM &NAME ) as well as participation in &NUM &NAME competition by the whole team . 
^ &NAME will undertake overall management of the project and provide research input and supervision of the PhD student on &NAME aspects of the project . 
^ &NAME will supervise design and implementation of the classifier and provide research input on the machine learning aspects of the project .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I 'm trying to grasp exactly how much information the GRs contain in comparison to the full parse with relation to the &NAME and &NAME anaphora resolution algorithm . 
^ My current hypothesis is that nothing would be gained from using the full parse instead of the &NAME ( as far as this algorithm is concerned ) , but I 'd like to have this confirmed ! 
^ I 'm not after a conclusion that says that you could recover the full parse tree from the &NAME , which I know is false . 
^ Also I guess that this would confirm that my implementation of the &NAME and &NAME algorithm ( at least for &NAME 's shallow parser ) is correct . 
^ This could be done by having an expert on the parser answer the following questions ( this is actually quite a bit of work -- sorry ) : ( I 've included an example and my current way of obtaining it out of the GRs . ) 
^ For a pronoun &CHAR and an np &CHAR 
^ &NUM ) We can find out that &CHAR is in the argument domain of &CHAR equally accurately from the GRs as from the full parse . 
^ E.g. She likes her . 
^ Current conditions : &CHAR ) ( ncmod ... &CHAR &CHAR ) &CHAR ) ( 2-place-rel &CHAR &CHAR ) Either ( 2-place-rel &CHAR &CHAR ) Or ( 3-place-rel ... &CHAR &CHAR ) Or ( 3-place-rel ! 
^ _ verb &CHAR ) ( xmod ... &CHAR verb ) and the same swapped over 
^ &NUM ) We can find out that &CHAR is in the adjunct domain of &CHAR equally accurately from the GRs . 
^ E.g. She sat near her . 
^ Current conditions : &CHAR ) ( nsubj &NAME &CHAR ... ) ( iobj ! 
^ _ &NAME &CHAR ) verb1 verb2 related through &NAME &CHAR ) ( ncmod ... &NAME &CHAR ) ( iobj ! 
^ _ &NAME &CHAR ) ( xmod ... &NAME &NAME ) 
^ &NUM ) Equally accurate to find out that : &CHAR is an argument of a head &CHAR , &CHAR is not a pronoun , and &CHAR is contained in &NAME 
^ E.g. He believes that the man is amusing . 
^ Current condition : ( ncsubj &NAME &CHAR ... ) ( ncsubj &NAME &CHAR ... ) verb1 verb2 related through &NAME 
^ &NUM ) We can find out that &CHAR is in the &NAME domain of &CHAR equally accurately from the GRs . 
^ E.g. &NAME 's portrait of him is interesting . 
^ Current condition : ( ncmod poss noun &CHAR ) ( ncmod !

</TEXT_NORMAL>
</SUBJECT>
<CONTENT-TYPE> TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII </CONTENT-TYPE>
<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Hi &NAME , 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ The word 'said ' has the part of speech &NAME ( verb ) , its lemma is 'say ' , and the corresponding meaning in WordNet can be got by searching for 'say ' and selecting the first sense ( attribute wnsn ) . 
^ The attribute lexsn , according to the documentation , and appended to the lemma , identifies the WordNet synset for that meaning . 
^ The attribute lexsn , appended to the lemma , will uniquely identify the meaning of the word ( what you obtain in this way is not , however , the synset ; instead , it points to &NUM unique synset ) . 
^ However , the lexsn attribute value is not unique for the synset . 
^ Many other words in &NAME have the same value : The lexsn by itself does not have give you much useful information . 
^ As indicated by WordNet manuals , the fields in the lexsn indicate : part of speech , number of lexicographer file , and number within that file ( adjectives would have some additional information ) . 
^ So there may be hundreds , or even thousands of different words having an identical lexsn ( most of the words in a lexicographer file will have identical lexsn ) . 
^ You may want to check out the WordNet manuals for additional information &WEBSITE 
^ Those words or lemmata do not belong to the same synset . 
^ It is important to know when word senses belong to the same synset , because this way synonym words __in the &NAME collection__ can be identified . 
^ The only way to know this , apart of consulting WordNet itself , is having unique synset identifiers in &NAME . 
^ Is the information in &NAME annotations enough to get that unique identification ? 
^ How can we do it ? 
^ The easiest ( and perhaps the fastest ) way to find the synset of a word ( given its lemma and lexsn ) , is to construct the sense key of a word ( lemma%lexsn ) , and look this up in the index.sense file provided with the WordNet data files .

^ Special Session in conjunction with the 6th International Conference on Business Information Systems &NAME &NUM 
^ &NAME Springs , &NAME , &NAME June &NUM , &NUM 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ Submission deadline : January &NUM , &NUM 
^ Introduction &NAME is an international conference with a long history . 
^ Although it was devoted to many research topics related to business information systems , &NUM important aspect has not been discussed yet - ontologies . 
^ According to the commonly accepted definition , ontology is a formal , explicit specification of a shared conceptualization . 
^ &CHAR special session organized within forthcoming &NAME &NUM is to fill this gap . 
^ &NAME are developed to provide a machine-processable semantics of information that is exchanged between different agents , both humans and software . 
^ They started in the Philosophy , evolved in Artificial Intelligence but nowadays other research communities adopt them very quickly . 
^ &NAME face strong expectations , especially in the business area : Knowledge Management and Electronic Commerce . 
^ &NAME are heavily exploited by Semantic Web - a vision to link data on the Web in a way that it can be used by machines not just for display purposes , but for automation , integration and reuse of data across various applications . 
^ There are a lot of very interesting and promising projects that make use of ontologies . 
^ Many different standards emerge . 
^ Many groups develop own tools to facilitate use of languages . 
^ No one is able to track all activities . 
^ Often we are unsure , which proposal will become a standard , which solution is most widely used . 
^ It will be advantageous to compare different solutions , proposals , tools , services . 
^ The goal of this special session is to share experiences about aforementioned systems , exchange ideas about improvements of existing standards and tools and creation of new systems , principles and applications . 
^ Its expected outcome is a common vision about the future directions . 
^ This special session is dedicated to groups who contribute to the development of ontologies that can be used in Business Information Systems . 
^ We are especially looking for innovative applications taking advantage of the ontologies . 
^ Topics of Interest &NAME &NUM invites submissions related to all aspects of the ontologies . 
^ Papers MUST clearly demonstrate relevance to the usage of ontologies in Business Information Systems . 
^ Suggested topics include but are not limited to : 
^ * Business Specific &NAME * &NAME for Data Warehousing , Electronic Commerce , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , etc. * &NAME &NAME E-Business * &NAME for Enterprise Integration * &NAME and &NAME * Economic Models , Financial Justification of &NAME * Semantic Web for Decision Support * Information Access , Searching the Semantic Web * Semantic Web-enabled Web Services * Agent Communication and Applications in the Semantic Web * Visual modeling of &NAME for &NAME * Electronic Trading Systems and &NAME * &NAME &NAME : e.g. &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , DAML-S , DAML+OIL * Web Services &NAME &NAME ( description , discovery and interoperation ) * Data / Information / Knowledge Integration by Use of &NAME * Use of &NAME &NAME in &NAME 
^ The successful papers should focus on complex solutions rather than technological aspects . 
^ Submission Papers to be considered for regular conference presentation and proceedings should be submitted via the regular conference submission process . 
^ Detailed instructions , especially formatting , will be published on conference Web page ( see &WEBSITE should be directed to : Dr. &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL . 
^ &NAME Research papers Papers should not exceed &NUM words . 
^ They should describe original research ( practical or theoretical ) . 
^ Theoretical papers should provide an overview of area of research closely related to ontologies in &NAME . 
^ Practical papers can describe an implemented tool or service that contributes to the ontologies . 
^ &NAME Work in progress Papers should not exceed &NUM words .

^ To all Fellows and Staff 
^ Just to inform you all of what is happening with regards to the Closure and how it may affect you . 
^ As you are aware the College will be closing down completely as from 3pm on Friday 20th December . 
^ However this does not apply to the &NAME or the Kitchens as there is a large function being held that evening in &NAME . 
^ The &NAME will be the last department to close which will be around 2pm on the 21st . 
^ It is expected that the building should by then be totally empty . 
^ If you are likely to be still in the building around that time please let the lodge know WELL IN ADVANCE ! 
^ However the &NAME will be open on certain dates throughout the holiday between 7.45am and 9.45am to recieve incoming mail . 
^ These dates are listed below 
^ 23rd , 24th , 27th , 28th , 30th , 31st , &NAME and the 2nd , 3rd , 4th &NAME &NUM . 
^ Anyone Fellow wishing to collect mail from the College must use the &NAME Drive entrance and the &NAME &NAME door . 
^ This door will remain on the &NAME but the inner door will be locked . 
^ A key for this door must be obtained from me before the 19th . 
^ Although the Porters are only here for &NUM hours on the days listed , the &NAME drive gate will remain open for longer . 
^ The evening security &NAME will lock that gate at 5pm . 
^ The &NAME will reopen at 8am on Sunday 5th January 
^ Many thanks

^ Did n't that happen ? 
^ Deadlines for project workplans are &NAME 's responsibility , I believe . 
^ However , I 'm not sure whether he 's in ( I 'm working from home and he 's not answering his phone ) and it 's now very urgent to get a message out . 
^ So if you ca n't get hold of him , then I propose the following : if the students were notified of their project choice last week , we make the deadline Friday 14th - i.e. their last day of lectures . 
^ If they were n't told , we give them until Friday 21st - i.e. same day as the practical hand-in .

^ I guess you looked at the website right ? 
^ Making the corpus ( body of email data ) available to the academic community means just that ! 
^ The idea is that the anonymisation procedure removes any references to real people / places / organisations / locations etc. and then the corpus is used as a benchmark training and testing resource for academics doing research into the junk email classification problem . 
^ That means that they will use computers to generate statistical probabilities of certain words appearing at certain places in emails , and then use these to classify new emails as either genuine or junk . 
^ Having a corpus that multiple people test systems on is vital for reproducibility of experiments , etc. 
^ Do n't worry - noone as seen any of the emails you let me use . 
^ ( Obviously I did n't use any of the &NUM from &NAME , etc. anyway ! ) The idea of the website is to convince people that it is safe to use the emails they donated as part of this corpus because it will be impossible to tell where the emails came from , where they were sent to , who they were about , etc. etc. 
^ But this will only happen with explicit permission from the donor , and if you 're not happy about yours being used in that way , then that 's fine !

<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ No problem . 
^ &NAME a little nit . 
^ The &NAME &NAME is rather mangled -- I assume you were aiming for &WEBSITE 
^ I 'm familiar with &NAME &NAME 's work and related projects . 
^ A lot of them seem rather basic in their use of stats ( e.g. not going much further than my A-level knowledge , which I hope to improve ! ) , though some of the discussion around &NAME is interesting : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ If you can point me at some good introductory material that would be helpful . 
^ I 'm not scared of heavy maths , though I 'm more used to the kind of thing you see in functional programming papers ... 
^ I 'm dissatisfied with existing stuff for a number of reasons . 
^ Firstly a lot of them are into fairly complicated parsing of the email ( especially &NAME ) in order to get at the words to feed into the stats engine . 
^ The problem with this is that the more complicated the parser , the more buggy ( especially when faced with broken MIME messages , malformed &NAME , etc ) , and the more open it is to spammers exploiting parser features to get past the filters ( you mention &NAME iagra and there 's a lot of &CHAR / n/l / a/r / g/i / n/g going on out there ) . 
^ They also tend to miss out features which ought to be useful , like punctuation , whitespace , mark-up peculiarities . 
^ &NAME ( apart from &NAME ) when classifying an email they only look at the presence or absence of a feature in the email , which means that they ca n't distinguish between lots of &NAME comments and no &NAME comments . 
^ This is probably why they find that it is n't an advantage to use &NAME features . 
^ ( CRM114 is neat but is vulnerable to over-training since its counters are only a byte wide . ) 
^ I 'm inclined to think that effective enough maths should be able to extract useful ( though non-linguistic ) information from the output of even the most braindead parser . 
^ &CHAR non-linguistic approach should automatically benefit from clues like word fragments in &NAME and tidbits in the message headers . 
^ Last night I spoke to &NAME &NAME of the &NAME &NAME Group ( who I have &NAME : &NAME ) and she did not tell me this idea was foolish &SMILEY 
^ Thirdly most of the existing stuff only works on behalf of the final recipient . 
^ I 'm interested in using tools like these to attack the problem at the network level . 
^ I 'd like to be able to aggregate training databases so that users who have n't set up their own filters can benefit from a centralized system that 's collectively trained by more advanced users . 
^ ( This has to be at the level of training databases rather than the original junk / wanted corpora for privacy and data protection reasons . ) 
^ It would be interesting to see if these training databases could be published and used as a kind of measure of whether the user or site would consent to receive a particular email ( using the word ' consent ' as in &WEBSITE outgoing email as well as incoming email , so that recipients have an idea of how spammy you think your email is ; if this correlates well with their previous experience of your email they could then spend fewer resources on filtering email from you ( e.g. filtering only a sample of the email just to check that it 's still in agreement ) ; if it correlates poorly then they can &NAME you down as untrustworthy and more probably a spammer . 
^ Which leads in to applying this kind of technique to the other context of an email , e.g. the dialect of &NAME spoken by the sending host , how spammy it has been in the past , is its &NAME set up competently , does it frequently send email to bad email addresses , etc. and publishing that as &CHAR ' greylist ' ( analogous to the blacklists published by people like &WEBSITE etc. but not so binary ) . 
^ Unlike the current blacklists you should be able to correlate someone else 's greylist with a locally-compiled one to work out how trustworthy it is and the extent to which you can use it to augment the local greylist . 
^ People could provide greylist aggregation services that have an objective trustworthiness unlike the subjective opinion of current blacklists . 
^ The rough aim of this is to end up with a system that encourages people to behave well , in such a way that there 's a clear path from the current situation to the desired end-point and a motivation to go down that path . 
^ It seems to fit in to the goals of the &NAME which is a good sign . 
^ Anyway those are my thoughts at the moment . 
^ I 'm interested in collaborating , and I can ( to some extent since there are privacy issues ) provide a real-world test for any system that results . 
^ We get a few hundred thousand messages a day and I have a system for pulling out a random sampling of them for testing stuff before installing it on a live system .

^ In text mining , I find it useful to distinguish between these &NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities : 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text , e.g. 'Mrs . 
^ &NAME lives in &NAME . ' 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . 
^ For instance , Mrs. &NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in &NAME . 
^ The distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . 
^ Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun ' &NUM ' using the 'Sender : ' field of the email rather than a name in the text . 
^ In practice , however , I find the &NUM to be very different . 
^ In particular , &NAME &NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . 
^ One assumes the whole document is ' about ' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . 
^ In &NAME &NUM , however , you have to be much more serious about the &NAME , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you 're interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . 
^ Anyway , I 'm trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about &NAME &NUM vs. &NAME &NUM . 
^ 'Declarative ' vs. ' &NAME ' ? 
^ ' Third person vs. First person ' ? 
^ Any suggestions ?

^ Hi &NAME ( and ddlbeta ) , 
^ Just to clarify , &NAME &NAME does n't have to enforce a particular threshold on the probability for classification . 
^ It merely characterizes a particular probability model ( conditional independence ) . 
^ Once you 've computed the probability using &NAME &NAME , the threshold at different levels that &NAME refers to can really be seen as adjusting the loss function used to do the final classification . 
^ Since the function you really want to optimize when classifying is the loss , you should make your prediction for the class &CHAR based on the rule : 
^ &CHAR argmin {C_pred} [ &NAME ( &CHAR ( &NAME | &CHAR ) * &CHAR ( &NAME , &NAME ) ) ] 
^ where &NAME are the possible predictions for the class you could make and &CHAR ( &CHAR , &CHAR ) is the loss incurred by predicting class &CHAR when the truth is class &NAME Under a &NUM / &NUM loss function , you should just predict the class with highest posterior probability , but there are certainly other loss functions you could use that would justify you assigning documents to classes other than the &NUM with raw maximal probability . 
^ This just means that you think making some kinds of errors are worse than others ( i.e. , greater loss for particular type of mistakes than others ) . 
^ So making the prec / recall curve can just be seen as coming out of adjusting the loss function linearly depending on whether you value precision or recall more in your particular application . 
^ Of course , there is a whole separate issue of whether the probabilities that come out of &NAME &NAME are really good estimates for the class probabilities ( which often they are not due to the inherent restrictions of the model ) , and sometimes a non-linear rescaling of these ' probabilities ' is done to try to get values that are more uniformly distributed . 
^ That opens another can of worms that you might not want to deal with , though . 
^ &NAME that helps , &NAME

^ You can threshold the classification decisions based on the confidence scores ( or probabilities ) that naive &NAME returns . 
^ Since the score that is given to each document / class pair is between &NUM and &NUM , you can use thresholds several thresholds ( &NUM , &NUM , and so on ) . 
^ Each threshold value will result in a different precision-recall value pair . 
^ If you plot those &NAME pairs , you can then find the &NUM point . 
^ &NAME that helps and if you need more clarification , let me know .

^ Thanks for your reply . 
^ My main concern with this type of thresholding is that this is no longer a &NAME classifier , because the &NAME decision rule assigns each example to the class with the highest score ( posterior probability ) , regardless of the absolute values of the scores . 
^ That 's what makes the Naive &NAME classifier so robust , even when the estimated probabilities are not reliable . 
^ But I guess people who report precision-recall &NUM points ( especially for the &NAME dataset ) use this technique ? 
^ &NAME 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Can someone tell me how to compute a precision / recall &NUM point for a Naive &NAME classifier ? 
^ From all the papers I read I understand that you have to vary some parameter to trade precision for recall , like the threshold in &NAME , but a &NAME classifier does not have an adjustable parameter . 
^ In the paper by &NAME / Damerau / &NAME ( &NUM ) they use different misclassification costs to trade precision for recall . 
^ Any other suggestions ? 
^ Thanks , &NAME

^ Dear all , 
^ &NAME University is holding a &NUM day workshop to discuss the recent advances and future direction for research in computational models of human sentence processing : 
^ Those working in the field who are interested in attending the workshop should contact &NAME &NAME for further details ( &EMAIL ) and confirmation , as space is strictly limited . 
^ &NAME : Computational models of sentence processing 
^ Dates : &NUM July , &NUM &NAME : &NAME &NUM ( minus &NUM ) &NAME , &NAME University &NAME , &NAME 
^ Further details are available from the workshop website : &WEBSITE 
^ The workshop is organized by The International Graduate College in Language Technology and Cognitive Systems , the Department of Computationa &CHAR Linguistics and Phonetics , and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ( &NAME ) , &NAME ; and is part of the &NAME &NUM ( Resource Adaptive Cognitive Systems ) . 
^ Workshop themes 
^ The workshop is intended to address what we view as &NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing . 
^ We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models , and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term . 
^ &NUM Models of working memory in language processing : to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour , are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account ? 
^ More generally , how should theories of sentence processing be situated within , and reconciled with , more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Broad coverage : how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research ? 
^ What kinds of mechanisms ( statistical , constraint-based , ... ) and linguistic theories ( dependency , generative , incremental ) seem most promising for developing broad coverage models ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Semantics in performance : how can we extend current syntactically-based accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge ( lexical , sentential , as well as plausibility ) ? 
^ Speakers : 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME Dyke &NAME Vasishth

^ PLACE : &NAME Research Ltd &NUM &CHAR &CHAR &NAME Avenue ( Off &NAME Road ) &NAME 
^ TITLE : ' There 's something about &NAME ' : Query-independent evidence in Web search 
^ Experiments in the information retrieval community have largely shown that query-independent evidence ( such as &NAME 's &NAME ) is useless in Web search , or even harmful . 
^ Yet experience in industry has been the opposite , with a widespread belief that static measures do improve search quality . 
^ Because of the necessary secrecy in industry , the belief has not been backed up with proof , peer-reviewed or otherwise . 
^ The annual collaborative &NAME Web Track experiments , which I help to coordinate , have been the source of many of the negative results . 
^ Are the negative results due to a flaw in the experiments or do they indicate that static measures really are useless ? 
^ In this talk I will present a new form of analysis which allows us to evaluate static measures . 
^ Results on &NUM different Web crawls show that static measures based on link and &NAME structure are _consistently useful_ , contradicting &NAME results . 
^ I will then discuss implications for how we evaluate Web search systems in future .

^ CALL FOR PAPERS 
^ CoNLL-2003 : &NAME Conference on Natural Language Learning 
^ Organized at HLT-NAACL-03 , &NAME , &NAME 
^ May &NUM - June &NUM &NUM 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME is an international forum for discussion and presentation of research on natural language learning . 
^ We invite submission of papers about natural language learning topics , including , but not limited to : 
^ - Computational models of human language acquisition - Computational models of the origins and evolution of language - &NAME learning methods applied to natural language processing tasks ( speech processing , phonology , morphology , syntax , semantics , discourse processing , language engineering applications ) - &NAME learning methods ( Rule Induction and Decision &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , Inductive Logic &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME ) - Biologically-inspired methods ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ) - Statistical methods ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME , maximum entropy , &NAME , Support Vector Machines ) - &NAME &NAME - &NAME learning , ensemble methods , meta-learning - &NAME &NAME &NAME analysis of language learning - Empirical and theoretical comparisons of language learning methods - Models of induction and analogy in &NAME 
^ &NAME is the yearly meeting organized by &NAME , the Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning . 
^ After previous &NAME meetings were held in &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , and &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ See &WEBSITE 
^ for more information about &NAME and &NAME . 
^ Special Theme 
^ As in previous years , in addition to submissions on the general topics listed above , we encourage submissions on a special theme . 
^ This year 's special theme is : 
^ Semi-supervised / unsupervised learning and sample selection techniques for language learning ( co-training , active learning , &NAME , etc ) . 
^ Supervised &NAME &NAME methods suffer from a 'data &NAME bottleneck ' which is especially harmful for language learning tasks where a lot of training data is needed ( e.g. parsing ) . 
^ Sample selection techniques , and combination of supervised learning with semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques may provide a solution to this problem . 
^ Shared &NAME 
^ This year 's workshop will also accept submissions for a shared task : machine learning approaches to named entity recognition . 
^ Special attention will be given to the use of multiple sources of knowledge , like training data , lists of examples and unannotated data . 
^ Interested groups will be supplied with the same training and testing material ( in several languages ) , and will all use the same evaluation criteria , thus allowing comparison between various learning methods . 
^ More information on the shared task will be available at : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ Invited Speaker 
^ &NAME 
^ Submissions 
^ * &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ Submit a full paper of no more than &NUM pages ( &NAME , &NAME or plain text &NAME ) by March &NUM , &NUM electronically to the address below . 
^ Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to produce a final paper to be published in the proceedings of the workshop , which will be available at the workshop for participants , and distributed afterwards by &NAME . 
^ &NAME submissions must follow the HLT-NAACL style

^ MISDIRECTED E-MAIL 
^ &CHAR couple from &NAME decided to go to &NAME for a long weekend to thaw out during one particularly icy winter . 
^ They planned to stay at the same hotel where they spent their honeymoon &NUM years before . 
^ Because both had jobs they found it difficult to coordinate their travel schedules , so it was decided that the husband would fly to &NAME on a Thursday , and his wife would follow him the next day . 
^ Upon arriving as planned , the husband checked into the hotel . 
^ In his room there was a computer so he decided to send his wife an e-mail back in &NAME . 
^ However , he accidentally left out &NUM letter in her address , and sent the e-mail , without realizing his error . 
^ In &NAME , a widow had just returned from her husband 's funeral . 
^ The dearly departed was a minister who had been called home to glory following a heart attack . 
^ The widow checked her e-mail , expecting messages from relatives and friends . 
^ Upon reading the first message , she fainted . 
^ The widow 's son rushed into the room , found his mother on the floor , and saw the computer screen which read : 
^ To : My Loving Wife Subject : I 've Arrived 
^ You 're probably surprised to hear from me . 
^ They have computers here now and you are allowed to send e-mails to your loved &NUM . 
^ I 've just arrived and checked in. 
^ I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow . 
^ Looking forward to seeing you then ! 
^ &NAME your journey is as uneventful as mine was . 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME is hot down here !

^ Dear Dr &NAME 
^ I have recently received your first term report for &NAME and am delighted that she is making good progress . 
^ I was disappointed about your negative comments about it being &CHAR ' nuisance ' her being at &NAME , due to the distance , which was an unusual remark to see in a supervision report . 
^ Of course I can appreciate your point , but I think that we all have to accept that as the university expands the area it covers has to be larger and hence all our journey times will increase . 
^ The position of the &NAME building is as much of a factor as the position of &NAME ! 
^ With the huge demand for college places for graduates outstripping supply in the system at the moment ( resulting in &NUM unplaced graduate students at the beginning of October in &NAME 's year ) , we think that building a new research graduate community at &NAME is a positive contribution to the research life of the university , and for this I hope we can rely on a supportive attitude from departments . 
^ &NAME is a great contributor to college life and as far as I am aware , this balances for her the ' nuisance ' of getting to the lab . 
^ Yours sincerely 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME College

^ Natural Language and Information Processing Group Seminar &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME : Automatic indexing and retrieval of crime-scene photographs : havin &CHAR 
^ recourse to Natural Language Processing 
^ Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University 
^ &NUM noon , Tuesday 3rd December , Room &NAME 
^ Computer Laboratory , &NAME &NAME Building , &NAME &NAME Avenue &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME : 
^ Current approaches in automatic text-based image indexing fail in capturi ng 
^ semantic information expressed in the captions , that is important for the 
^ subsequent retrieval of the images . 
^ The indexing and retrieval prototype 
^ developed within the Scene Of Crime Information System ( SOCIS ) project 
^ attempts to go beyond keyword-based approaches and methods that extract 
^ syntactic relations from captions . 
^ SOCIS relies on advanced Natural Langu age 
^ Processing techniques in order to extract relational facts from captions . 
^ These relational facts consist of a pragmatic relation '' and the entiti es 
^ this relation connects ( triples of the form : ARG1- &NAME &NAME ) . 
^ In SOCIS , the 
^ triples are used as complex image indexing terms ; however , the extraction 
^ mechanism is used not only for indexing purposes but also for image retri eval . 
^ Extracting the corresponding relational structures from free-natural &NAME uage 
^ queries , SOCIS attempts to match the query triples to the indexing triple &CHAR and 
^ retrieve the appropriate images with high precision and recall . 
^ We have 
^ implemented this approach for crime investigation , an application domain where 
^ efficient querying of large crime-scene photograph databases is of crucia &CHAR 
^ importance . 
^ In this presentation , I will start with a demonstration of the current SO &NAME 
^ prototype and an overview of the application scenario and I will then foc us on 
^ the &NAME techniques used for developing the prototype . 
^ The main extraction 
^ mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the 
^ ' query triples - indexing triples ' matching mechanism ) . 
^ ( All welcome - For instructions on how to get to the Computer Laboratory , 
^ please see : &WEBSITE

^ I did my PhD on concurrency in the lab and have subsequently spent some time doing linguistic training . 
^ I 'm interested in translation issues , with particular reference to , currently , unwritten languages . 
^ I was wondering whether there was any overlap with the work you do and whether you would be interested in meeting up to chat about the field . 
^ &NAME was n't sure whether you were working on non-English languages , so I do n't know whether this is of any interest to you .

</TEXT_NORMAL>
</SUBJECT>

<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ The Second Workshop on &NAME and Linguistic Theories ( &NAME &NUM ) &NUM November &NUM , &NAME , &NAME 
^ Workshop motivation and aims 
^ &NAME are a language resource that provides annotations of natural languages at various levels of structure : at the word level , the phrase level , the sentence level , and sometimes also at the level of function-argument structure . 
^ &NAME have become crucially important for the development of data-driven approaches to natural language processing , human language technologies , grammar extraction and linguistic research in general . 
^ There are a number of on-going projects on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack them ( Bulgarian , Danish , Portugese , Spanish , Turkish ) and a number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific purposes for languages that already have them ( &NAME ) . 
^ The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and more theory-dependent ( &NAME &NAME &NAME and other dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependendency treebank , the Italian treebank ( &NAME ) , and the Turkish treebank ( &NAME ) ; &NAME &NAME &NAME , Polish &NAME &NAME , Bulgarian HPSG-based &NAME , etc. ) . 
^ Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary information flow between them . 
^ This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced students working in these areas . 
^ The second workshop will be held in &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NUM november &NUM . 
^ ( The first was held in &NAME , &NAME in September &NUM ; see &WEBSITE 
^ Topics of interest 
^ We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and linguistic theories , including but not limited to : 
^ - design principles and &NAME schemes for treebanks ; 
^ - applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and &NAME ; 
^ - the role of linguistic theories in treebank development ; 
^ - treebanks as a basis for linguistic research ; 
^ - evaluation of treebanks ; 
^ - tools for creation and management of treebanks ; 
^ - standards for treebanks . 
^ Important dates 
^ Deadline for workshop abstract submission &NUM August &NUM 
^ Notification of acceptance &NUM September &NUM 
^ &NAME version of paper for workshop proceedings &NUM October &NUM 
^ Submissions 
^ Papers should describe existing research connected to the topics of the workshop . 
^ The presentation at the workshop will be &NUM minutes long ( &NUM minutes for presentation and &NUM minutes for questions and discussion ) . 
^ Each submission should include : title ; author ( &CHAR ) ; affiliation ( &CHAR ) ; and contact author 's e-mail address , postal address , telephone and fax numbers . 
^ Extended abstracts ( maximum &NUM words , plain-text format or &NAME ) should be sent to : 
^ Name : &NAME &NAME Email : &EMAIL 
^ Those who wish to attend without offering a paper are asked to briefly motivate their interest , as the number of participants is limited . 
^ The final version of the accepted papers should not be longer than &NUM &NAME pages . 
^ Instructions for formatting and presentation of the final version will be sent to authors upon notification of acceptance .

^ &NAME , 
^ I think I mentioned that I was involved with the CUED SVR-Group 's &NAME ' project . 
^ Well , we have an Evaluation deadline in late April and , before then , we want to try and construct some kind of system that identifies slash unit ( &NAME , i.e. , quasi sentences and quasi clauses ) boundaries in the speech stream . 
^ The current plan is to use lexical and prosodic information sources , but I think we also need some kind of shallow parser to enable us to identify sentence internal divisions - i.e. , 
^ / the man is tall / / and the man is slim / 
^ where the / ' &NAME &NAME boundaries : ( obviously ) lexical and prosodic info wo n't always help us to spot these divisions . 
^ I was wondering , therefore , if you had any useful reasonably-portable parsers lurking on your system that we could borrow / adapt ? 
^ The input will be Speech Recogniser output , which could be converted into a parser-compatible format if necessary . 
^ &NAME Woodland thinks that we have some older parsers hiding somewhere on our system , but I thought that you might have something more powerful / subtle ... 
^ Any thoughts or suggestions ? 
^ Yours , 
^ &NAME .

^ Do people have any experience with &CHAR ) taking multiple shorter fragment samples ( with possibly unknown boundaries ) and classifying each separately ?

^ Dear Ms. &NAME , 
^ A one-day conference and debate on the crossover issues of authorship , academic freedom and intellectual property rights in higher education - &NAME 28th April &NUM 
^ We all recognise that the issue of ownership and control of &NAME in universities has never been more critical than it is right now . 
^ And as the power of web technology increases , so too does the ability of the higher education community to publish and distribute teaching and learning materials , and the products of research . 
^ But , who should own and control that material once it 's created ? 
^ The Publishers Association and &NAME University are holding a conference to discuss this question and as members of the &NAME we are supporting the organisation of this conference and wanted to let you know about it . 
^ Here at &NAME Education , we are committed to delivering the very best education solutions to our customers . 
^ And as active members of both the &NAME and CAPP ( Council for Academic and Professional Publishers ) we 're focusing on the key issues facing higher education today . 
^ The conference addresses the issue of &NAME and will hear the case from the perspective of * Teachers and researchers who want the results of their work made public , but worry about losing control of it ; * Universities who want to provide access to students and researchers , but are concerned about managing the rights they own ; and * Publishers , whose role as ' value-added ' intermediaries may change as creators look increasingly to go directly to their users 
^ This conference will be of great interest to anyone involved in the process of creating , distributing or managing intellectual property in higher education . 
^ So , if you think a colleague may be interested in attending , please forward this email on our behalf . 
^ For the full conference brochure including speaker programme , registration form and details of reduced rates for permanent-post academics , visit the Publishers Association website at &WEBSITE hard copies , e-mail &NAME &NAME at &EMAIL . 
^ Yours sincerely , 
^ &NAME &NAME Email Marketing Executive

^ &NAME , 
^ The first instance is similar to the problems encountered in the &NAME conferences , and I think the term ' extraction ' is often used , and it involves &NAME with or without anaphora / cataphora resolution . 
^ I am not sure what you will call the second instance , but I tend to think of it in terms of 'mining ' or ' classification ' . 
^ This is why , I think of the difference should be in terms of the techniques used for the task rather than the data content itself ( assuming the data is NOT fielded ) . 
^ Because if you are NOT using NLP-like techniques , the fact that Mrs. &NAME lives in &NAME is explicitly / implicitly stated in the text does not help you much . 
^ &NAME 
^ In text mining , I find it useful to distinguish between these &NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities : 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text , e.g. 'Mrs . 
^ &NAME lives in &NAME . ' 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . 
^ For instance , Mrs. &NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in &NAME . 
^ The distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . 
^ Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun ' &NUM ' using the 'Sender : ' field of the email rather than a name in the text . 
^ In practice , however , I find the &NUM to be very different . 
^ In particular , &NAME &NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . 
^ One assumes the whole document is ' about ' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . 
^ In &NAME &NUM , however , you have to be much more serious about the &NAME , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you 're interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . 
^ Anyway , I 'm trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about &NAME &NUM vs. &NAME &NUM . 
^ 'Declarative ' vs. ' &NAME ' ? 
^ ' Third person vs. First person ' ? 
^ Any suggestions ? 
^ Cheers , &NAME

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ Here are some ( genuine - I think ! ) lingspam results . 
^ precision for GENUINE : &NUM recall for GENUINE : &NUM precision for &NAME : &NUM recall for &NAME : &NUM F1 for GENUINE : &NUM F1 for &NAME : &NUM 
^ Some comparative published results for different approaches are : 
^ NB - F1 for &NAME : &NUM &NAME - F1 for &NAME : &NUM Stacking - F1 for &NAME : &NUM &NAME - F1 for &NAME : &NUM 
^ I 'm not sure why the published results for the first &NUM classifiers are so low - you said that you got ~.97 F1 for &NAME ? ? 
^ My results were obtained by interpolating &NUM discounted bigrams for each class , representing the body and subject , with the body bigram given a higher cutoff point to balance between the &NUM and 2-gram distributions . 
^ I am getting around &NUM &NAME on my corpus , but the vast majority of the misclassifications are due to spam messages containing virtually no text at all . 
^ This is presumably due to the fact that these messages had attachments which were lost or from which the text was n't successfully &WEBSITE . 
^ The nature of the misclassifications means that an &NAME extension to my classifier could only have an extremely negligible positive impact , if any at all . 
^ I wonder if it would be worth filtering these very short messages out of the corpus ( or at least out of the test set ) on the assumption that a deployed system would do better at extracting the text from attachments . 
^ Anyway , I 'm going to try a few other ideas ...

^ Dear all 
^ As a part of a classified ads posting system , a group of natural language 
^ processing students supervised by me have to develop a gross language detection system for the Spanish language . 
^ I do not know if there is any work in this area ( except maybe [ &NUM ] ) . 
^ Dou you have ideas of how to do this ? 
^ It seems rather heuristic , but my basic idea is : 
^ &NUM To build a dictionary of forbidden words ( &CHAR * * &CHAR , etc ) 
^ &NUM To develop a set of regular expresions that allow to detect variations 
^ of the forbiden words ( e.g. if ' xyzt ' is a forbidden word , then we have to 
^ detect ' &NAME ' , ' &NAME ' or little letter changes for slang - &CHAR ' &CHAR ' instead &CHAR ' &CHAR ' , etc ) .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I managed to find a copy of &NAME &NAME 's report . 
^ Her best results are as follows : 
^ &NAME &NAME : &NUM &NAME &NAME : &NUM 
^ using &NAME with no smoothing ( she reports degraded performance with smoothing ) 
^ That compares with my best results of : 
^ &NAME &NAME : &NUM &NAME &NAME : &NUM 
^ using smoothed , linearly backed-off bigram &NAME 
^ The results are 'significantly ' different when you consider that across the whole corpus , she would misclassify ( roughly ) : 
^ &NUM &NAME messages &NUM &NAME messages 
^ whereas I would misclassify : 
^ &NUM Genuine messages &NUM &NAME messages 
^ ( bearing in mind that there are over &NUM times as many genuine messages as spam ) 
^ It shows that my &NAME technique works at least somewhat better than simple &NAME . 
^ Cheers ,

^ &NAME , Many thanks for your introduction and reference material - very interesting ! 
^ I 'm a &NAME &NAME Science Graduate , who started off in consultancy , but have spent the last &NUM years building a company based around &NAME . 
^ The first &NUM years were pure research and development , and the company was incorporated about &NUM months ago , at that stage primarily to form an investment vehicle . 
^ We now have our first product nearing completion . 
^ Further details about the company and me can be found at &WEBSITE warn you in advance that the web site gives virtually no details about our &NAME technology and that the product details are deliberately vague until the next product release . 
^ Its very refreshing to see your company being based on academic work and therefore all the technical details being published . 
^ Since we use our own proprietary technology , it is unlikely that we would look to license RASP , and it will be difficult for me to discuss many technological aspects of my work . 
^ However , I think it would be daft to pass up the opportunity to meet and share ideas wherever possible . 
^ I can think of a number of areas that I 'd be interested in discussing e.g. fund-raising experiences , &NAME resources , &NAME , and some areas of technology . 
^ I 'm based in &NAME . 
^ I have a number of delivery commitments over the next month or so , but I never pass up the opportunity to return to &NAME . 
^ It would be convenient for me to meet up with you in &NAME any time on or after 13th January . 
^ Let me know if you are interested . 
^ Cheers , 
^ &NAME . 
^ &NAME &NAME Chief &NAME &NAME and Founder infoMesh limited 
^ mobile : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM &NUM 
^ Apologies for not responding to &NAME &NAME ' introduction sooner . 
^ I 'm enclosing some draft information and url pointers that will help you figure out , quickly I hope , whether there are any points of contact between &NAME and &NAME , which is at the about to be incorporated ' stage . 
^ all the best , 
^ &NAME &NAME

^ &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME &NAME provides commercial licensing , support and consultancy for the robust accurate statistical parsing ( RASP ) toolkit . 
^ The toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification , summarisation , mining and querying . 
^ It is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems , which go beyond pure term indexing or domain-specific entity extraction . 
^ The RASP toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to , properties predicated of these relations , and relations which hold between them . 
^ For instance , the following text sentence -- from the transcript of President &NAME 's speech at the &NAME Museum Center on 7th October , &NUM -- is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath : 
^ Members of the &NAME of both political parties , and members of the United Nations Security Council , agree that &NAME &NAME is a threat to peace and must disarm . 
^ Entities : [ Member+s of the &NAME of both political parties ] [ Member+s ] [ the &NAME ] [ both political parties ] [ political parties ] [ parties ] [ &NAME &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ the United Nations Security Council ] [ United Nations ] [ the Security Council ] [ the Council ] 
^ Relations : [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] 
^ The actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats ( href ) 
^ Term-based systems represent text documents as bags of words ' ( i.e. sets of characters between white spaces ) but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document , such as &NAME &NAME ' , political parties ' , the United Nations Security Council ' or 'members of &NAME of both political parties ' . 
^ Representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents , such as the &NAME &NAME Council ' or the Security Council ' , and thus also a better way of classifying , summarising or querying document content via salient entities . 
^ The RASP system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domain-independent way into names ( subdivided into places , people , organisations ) , numbers ( including ranges , dates , etc ) , measure phrases ( ounce , year , etc ) , temporal expressions ( days , weeks , months ) , directions ( north , south , etc ) , and so forth . 
^ Relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for cross-indexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations ( href ) . 
^ Extant systems for extracting entities from text , based on deterministic finite-state pattern matching , rely heavily on manually-supplied domain-specific lexical information from the outset . 
^ The relational information recovered by the RASP system can be used to index who did what to whom ' and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection . 
^ &CHAR relational pattern like [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] agree [ ? ] ' ( What does the &NAME &NAME Council agree ? ' ) can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise , specific and small amounts of focussed information . 
^ This approach to information retrieval deals naturally with non-contiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation ( [ the Security Council ] [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] ) as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems , such as negation ( [ the Council ] [ not agree ] [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] $ neq $ [ the Council ] agree [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] ) . 
^ The RASP toolkit achieves about &NUM accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary English texts , without making use of domain-specific lexical information . 
^ It has been used to date to analyse about &NUM million words of English . 
^ &CHAR recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems . 
^ &NAME and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semi-automatic customisation on domain and / or application specific text . 
^ The toolkit is fully compatible with existing &NAME standards for text &NAME up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web ( &NAME / &NAME href ) . 
^ The cofounders of &NAME are &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . 
^ The RASP toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the University of &NAME , &NAME Laboratory and University of &NAME , School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences . 
^ &NAME &NAME has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit .

^ Hi , 
^ It has been quite a few years since people started reporting works on &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) extraction , but seems like there is not clear definition of &NAME yet . 
^ In some cases , we can extract many grammatical word strings like ' come from ' , ' live with ' but are they &NAME ? 
^ If not why ? 
^ I personally prefer to think &NAME as relatively stable word groups ( mostly adjacent &NUM ) that have relatively highly co-occuring probabilities than free conbinations , but that may have more flexible structures than dioms or fixed phrases do . 
^ Am I right , or is there any 'standard ' definition of &NAME ? 
^ Any suggestions and comments will be appreciated .

^ ABSTRACT : 
^ Social insects provide us with a powerful metaphor to create decentralized systems of simple interacting , and often mobile , agents . 
^ The emergent collective intelligence of social insects 'swarm intelligence ' resides not in complex individual abilities but rather in networks of interactions that exist among individuals and between individuals and their environment . 
^ The study of &NAME colonies behavior and of their self-organizing capabilities is of interest to knowledge retrieval / management and decision support systems sciences , because it provides models of distributed adaptive organization which are useful to solve difficult optimization , classification , and distributed control problems , among others . 
^ In the present work we overview some models derived from the observation of real ants , emphasizing the role played by stigmergy as distributed communication paradigm , and we present a novel strategy ( &NAME ) to tackle clustering , unsupervised data exploratory analysis as well as data retrieval problems . 
^ Moreover and according to our knowledge , this is also the first application of &NAME systems into digital image retrieval problems . 
^ Nevertheless , the present algorithm could be applied to any type of numeric data .

^ Having thought about it a bit further , I 'm thinking it would be better to find a shorter paper , dealing with a specific technique that I could analyse critically and relate to other material . 
^ I do n't think either of the &NAME papers I 've looked at is going to be very useful for that . 
^ What I might do is to take the section from &NAME &NUM that deals with syntactic indexing ( referenced by the original &NAME paper ) and look at that in more depth .

^ Previous attempts to deal with bullying problems in schools have had short-lived success . 
^ &NAME aims to be an innovative educational initiative for dealing with bullying problems by allowing children to try out different perspectives involved . 
^ Children will also have the opportunity to examine different coping mechanisms to deal with bullying and determine whether these are successful or not . 
^ Both technical and psychological teams are involved with the project . 
^ The focus of the talk will be on the psychological contribution to the project in terms of developing bullying scenarios for children , the psychological profiles of children involved in bullying , and evaluation techniques for the project . 
^ Examples of bullying scenarios , synthetic characters , models of the school environments , and research into the development of empathy between the child user of the system and synthetic characters will be provided .

^ &NAME : &NAME - A &NAME &NAME Approach to &NAME &NAME . 
^ Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME University 
^ &NAME : 
^ &NAME is a type of figurative language where &NUM entity is used to refer to another related entity . 
^ &CHAR typical example is 
^ ( &NUM ) Does he drive a &NAME ? 
^ In ( &NUM ) , the name of a company ' &NAME ' is used to refer to a car produced by that company . 
^ Most traditional approaches to metonymy understanding rely on large amounts of world knowledge and are not easily scalable and / or portable . 
^ In the MASCARA project we explored supervised statistical classification methods as an alternative approach . 
^ We will present the following results : 
^ &NUM The regularity and productivity of metonymic readings make it possible to reduce metonymy understanding to a classification task comparable to classic word sense disambiguation for the large majority of metonymic readings . 
^ &NUM Grammatical argument-head relations are an appropriate feature for such a classification task and , in particular , more predictive for metonymy recognition than e.g. , collocations . 
^ &NUM Data sparseness in argument-head relations can be at least partially overcome by the integration of thesaurus information without increasing the size of the training data . 
^ &NUM We also explore the effect that parser accuracy has on the recognition algorithm and compare the difficulty of metonymy recognition to classic word sense disambiguation .

^ OK &NAME . 
^ The code thus far is in /Nfs / elmer-e5 / homes-3 / bwm23 / unix_home / project / code ( should be readable ) 
^ with the sub-directory 'src ' containing C++ classes for language model representation . 
^ The code directory contains loads of perl scripts and things for various tasks , mostly related to the email anonymiser . 
^ The language model construction tools are also written in perl ( make_unigram and make_bigram ) . 
^ I have collected results for the unigram classifier , based on interpolating weighted LMs for the subject and body fields , yielding around &NUM &NAME for both spam and genuine . 
^ I am currently working on integrating a bigram &NAME into the classifier , so as to test various issues such as backing-off strategies , etc. 
^ The write-up is on its way to being started ! 
^ I will make some progress on that shortly . 
^ I have over &NUMil words of non-spam , and I will probably add the &NAME corpus soon , but I 'm going to work with the stuff I 've got rather than spending much time integrating new data at the moment .

^ Apologies for multiple postings . 
^ Call for Papers : 
^ Journal of &NAME &NAME 
^ Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
^ &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &NAME University , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME , &EMAIL 
^ The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . 
^ It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . 
^ The usefulness of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950's and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . 
^ The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . 
^ This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . 
^ This special issue of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . 
^ Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : 
^ * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . 
^ Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? 
^ How should they be combined ? 
^ Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? 
^ Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? 
^ * Evaluation of &NAME systems . 
^ Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? 
^ Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? 
^ Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? 
^ Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? 
^ * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . 
^ How do these affect &NAME ? 
^ How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? 
^ Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? 
^ What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? 
^ * The effect of &NAME on applications . 
^ To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? 
^ What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? 
^ What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? 
^ * Minimising the need for hand-tagged data . 
^ Hand-tagged text is expensive and difficult to obtain while un-tagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . 
^ What techniques can be used to make use of un-tagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? 
^ What use can be made of parallel text ? 
^ Can un-tagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ? 
^ Submission Information 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM October &NUM 
^ All submissions will be subject to the normal peer review process for this journal . 
^ Submissions in electronic form ( &NAME ) are strongly preferred and must conform to the &NAME specifications , which are available at :

^ &NAME &NAME provides commercial licensing , support and consultancy for the robust accurate statistical parsing ( RASP ) toolkit . 
^ The toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification , summarisation , mining and querying . 
^ It is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems , which go beyond pure term indexing or domain-specific entity extraction . 
^ The RASP toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to , properties predicated of these relations , and relations which hold between them . 
^ For instance , the following text sentence -- from the transcript of President &NAME 's speech at the &NAME Museum Center on 7th October , &NUM -- is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath : 
^ Members of the &NAME of both political parties , and members of the United Nations Security Council , agree that &NAME &NAME is a threat to peace and must disarm . 
^ Entities : [ Member+s of the &NAME of both political parties ] [ Member+s ] [ the &NAME ] [ both political parties ] [ political parties ] [ parties ] [ &NAME &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ the United Nations Security Council ] [ United Nations ] [ the Security Council ] [ the Council ] 
^ Relations : [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] 
^ The actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats ( href ) 
^ Term-based systems represent text documents as bags of words ' ( i.e. sets of characters between white spaces ) but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document , such as &NAME &NAME ' , political parties ' , the United Nations Security Council ' or 'members of &NAME of both political parties ' . 
^ Representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents , such as the &NAME &NAME Council ' or the Security Council ' , and thus also a better way of classifying , summarising or querying document content via salient entities . 
^ The RASP system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domain-independent way into names ( subdivided into places , people , organisations ) , numbers ( including ranges , dates , etc ) , measure phrases ( ounce , year , etc ) , temporal expressions ( days , weeks , months ) , directions ( north , south , etc ) , and so forth . 
^ Relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for cross-indexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations ( href ) . 
^ Extant systems for extracting entities from text , based on deterministic finite-state pattern matching , rely heavily on manually-supplied domain-specific lexical information from the outset . 
^ The relational information recovered by the RASP system can be used to index who did what to whom ' and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection . 
^ &CHAR relational pattern like [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] agree [ ? ] ' ( What does the &NAME &NAME Council agree ? ' ) can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise , specific and small amounts of focussed information . 
^ This approach to information retrieval deals naturally with non-contiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation ( [ the Security Council ] &NUM [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] ) as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems , such as negation ( [ the Council ] [ not agree ] [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] $ neq $ [ the Council ] agree [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] ) . 
^ The RASP toolkit achieves about &NUM accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary English texts , without making use of domain-specific lexical information . 
^ It has been used to date to analyse about &NUM million words of English . 
^ &CHAR recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems . 
^ &NAME and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semi-automatic customisation on domain and / or application specific text . 
^ The toolkit is fully compatible with existing &NAME standards for text &NAME up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web ( &NAME / &NAME href ) . 
^ &CHAR non-exclusive commercial licence to use the RASP toolkit , which includes &NUM hours support and consultancy to assist with customising and integrating the toolkit into the client 's application , costs $ pounds $ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ The toolkit is available free for non-commercial use including prototyping and proof-of-concept work in industry . 
^ Support for this and / or general consultancy on &NAME / IR applications and systems is available from &NAME Ltd at a rate of $ pounds $ &NUM / hour . 
^ The cofounders of &NAME are &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . 
^ The RASP toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the University of &NAME , &NAME Laboratory and University of &NAME , School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences . 
^ &NAME &NAME has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit .

^ As our eval licence for the tagger ran out , we cannot reproduce those , but we can reproduce a format which only uses the sentence segmentor .

^ Greetings all , 
^ Last fall ( &NUM ) I started to collect information about &NAME and &NAME researchers in Latin &NAME . 
^ There was quite a bit of response and interest , so it seemed like having a more organized means of collecting and providing this information would be useful . 
^ We have created a web site where folks who are located in or are originally from Latin &NAME can register and provide information about themselves and their research . 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ We just put the site up &NAME &NUM so there are only a few entries thus far , but hopefully that will increase over time . 
^ Please come &NAME around - we hope that this will be an interesting and useful resource . 
^ Below is a note I 've started mailing around announcing the site . 
^ I 'd be grateful if you could forward this to interested colleagues , and of course register if you are in or from Latin &NAME ! 
^ Thanks ! 
^ &NAME 
^ Dear Colleague , 
^ I am happy to announce the creation of the Registry of Latin American Researchers in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics . 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ The objective of the Registry is to provide a centralized source of information for and about students , professors , researchers , and practitioners in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics who currently reside in Latin &NAME . 
^ If this describes you , or if you are originally from Latin &NAME but living elsewhere , please take a moment to register . 
^ The creation of the Registry is a part of the Latin American outreach activities of the North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics ( &NAME ) . 
^ Our hope is that the Registry will help promote Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics research being carried out in Latin &NAME . 
^ In addition , we want to encourage further collaboration among researchers within Latin &NAME and with the rest of the world . 
^ Thanks very much for your help . 
^ Please spread the word about the our new Registry of Latin American Researchers in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics !

^ If it does n't I 'll investigate whether we can run on specific &NAME machines which are n't being used for projects .

^ &NAME , I will do this , and split my script so that it does &NUM ) preprocessing + lemmatizing and &NUM ) parsing + patternset extraction phases separately . 
^ There is &NUM problem though . 
^ The script requires as input a file which lists all the verb forms we are interested in ( e.g. ' give , gave , given . ... ' ) . 
^ I built this file manually for the &NUM verbs , but how to obtain it for all the &NUM verbs ? 
^ We could of course preprocess and lemmatize all the &NUM corpora and then it would be easy : we could just search for the base forms . 
^ I am not sure how long this would take though , and the trouble is we will anyway need the verb form list for rungoogle.sh .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ &NUM ) ask someone who is a unix guru -- I asked &NAME &NAME and &NUM ) was the best he cld come up with 
^ I can have a go at ( some of ) this if you want me to , but I would be inclined to merge the scripts anyway so that you go thru ' the on-line corpora in order and finally go to google , stopping on the basis of the current verb 's freq and accumulated citation count and some upper bounds like high10k med1k , &NAME , &NAME , then you 'll have all the data for each verb in a single file which will help organise subsequent stages . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Thanks -- I 'll have a look , I can probably get it fixed . 
^ I would not merge the scripts though . 
^ It 's easy to organize the data and gather all the statistics in the end , but merging the scripts would be risky . 
^ &NAME is not only slow but also less reliable : if it halts ( which may happen due to reasons beyond us ) it would halt all the processing . 
^ So I 'd set it running separately and keep an eye on it . 
^ &NAME has also got this &NUM document per day limit . 
^ How will we handle that -- by simply getting enough keys ?

^ &NAME 
^ Recent advances on tagging and other shallow processing tools have confirmed the key importance of these applications to enable subsequent stages of efficient deep linguistic processing , and to improve the quality of information retrieval services and support the semantic web . 
^ The goal of this workshop will be to provide a forum to discuss experiences and exchange results between people working in this area , and to review the current state of the art in this diverse field in what concerns the Portuguese language . 
^ We would like to invite presentations reporting on recent advances on all aspects of the shallow processing of Portuguese . 
^ We encourage the representation of a large , multidisciplinary range of aspects including but not limited to issues related to the entire production cycle of &NAME taggers and other shallow processing tools such as tokenizers , stemmers , &NAME detectors , named entity recognizers , &NAME chunkers , &NAME tools , &NAME attachment resolvers , terminology extractors , etc. , ranging from the collection of stop lists to the integration of these tools into broader systems and applications , and including a.o. methodologies for accurate hand tagging , linguistic resources for training and evaluation , learning algorithms and their eventual tuning to Portuguese , finite-state solutions , evaluation metrics and results , selected linguistic generalizations and specifications , etc. 
^ We invite presentations about relevant solutions and approaches to the above issues as well as descriptions or demos of tools , resources , systems or projects .

^ Library catalogs . 
^ Most university library catalogs contain millions of records , and each record is assigned either a Library of &NAME &NAME or some form of &NAME number depending on what part of thre world you live in ( both are well-defined hierarchical classifications ) . 
^ The drawbacks are that the documents can be very small--they are bibliographic records , not full text--though you could try applying to library services with large Web catalog for access to Web data ( e.g. &NAME ) ; they tend to be skewed towards specialty areas ; and that you may have to do quite a bit of preprocessing to get them into the form you need . 
^ See &WEBSITE information and the &NAME source to an &NAME classifier based on &NAME 's &NAME implementation , hierarchical decomposition , and library catalog training data ; I have an unpublished paper on this work somewhere .

^ CALL FOR PAPERS 
^ ACL-2003 Workshop on &NAME Expressions : &NAME , &NAME and &NAME 
^ &NUM July &NUM , &NAME , &NAME 
^ * * * &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM April &NUM * * * 
^ WEBSITES 
^ Workshop website : &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME website : &WEBSITE 
^ WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 
^ &NAME expressions ( &NAME ) include a large range of linguistic phenomenon , such as phrasal verbs ( e.g. ' add up ' ) , nominal compounds ( e.g. ' telephone box ' ) , and institutionalized phrases ( e.g. 'salt and &NAME ' ) , and they can be syntactically and / or semantically idiosyncratic in nature . 
^ &NAME are used frequently in everyday language , usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word . 
^ &CHAR considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject , both in terms of theory and practice , but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research , there is still a gap between the needs of &NAME and the descriptive tradition of linguistics . 
^ Owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat &NAME properly , they pose a real challenge for &NAME . 
^ Most real-world applications tend to ignore &NAME or address them simply by listing . 
^ However , it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately . 
^ This particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing ( e.g. machine translation , question-answering , summarisation , generation ) . 
^ In recent years there has been a growing awareness in the &NAME community of the problems that &NAME pose and the need for their robust handling . 
^ &CHAR considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area , some within large research projects dedicated to &NAME ( e.g. the &NAME Expression Project ) . 
^ There is also a growing interest in &NAME in projects focused on tasks such as parsing ( e.g. Robust Accurate &NAME &NAME ( RASP ) ) and word sense disambiguation ( e.g. MEANING - &NAME &NAME &NAME Language Technologies ) which are required by real-world applications . 
^ Previous workshops on &NAME have focused on certain &NAME types , notably collocations , terminology and named entities . 
^ There are , however , further subtypes of &NAME , which are highly relevant for &NAME tasks but which have not to date received specific attention . 
^ &NUM example are lexicalised ( non- or semi-compositional ) &NAME which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation . 
^ TARGET AUDIENCE 
^ This workshop is intended to bring together &NAME researchers working on all areas of &NAME . 
^ The objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area , to establish common themes between different approaches , and to discuss future trends , with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different &NAME ( sub ) types pose for real-world &NAME applications . 
^ AREAS OF INTEREST 
^ Papers are invited on , but not limited to , the following topics : 
^ * Theoretical research on &NAME * &NAME taxonomies , classifications and databases * Corpus based analysis of &NAME * Cross-lingual analysis of &NAME types , use , and behaviour * Methods for identification and extraction of &NAME ( machine learning , statistical , example- or rule-based , or hybrid ) * Evaluation of &NAME extraction methods * Integration of &NAME data into grammars and &NAME applications ( e.g. machine translation and generation ) * &NAME &NAME ( or &NAME types ) pose for &NAME applications and solutions proposed 
^ Papers can cover &NUM or more of these areas .

^ LEGITIMATE AND LEGAL 
^ THIS IS A LEGITIMATE , LEGAL , MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY . 
^ It does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . 
^ If you believe that someday you 'll get that big break that you 've been waiting for , THIS IS IT ! 
^ Simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . 
^ This e-mail marketing program works perfectly ... &NUM , EVERY TIME . 
^ E-mail is the sales tool of the future . 
^ Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising NOW ! ! ! 
^ The longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . 
^ Get your piece of this program now ! 
^ MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING ( &NAME ) has finally gained respectability . 
^ It is being taught in the &NAME Business School , both &NAME Research and the &NAME &NAME &NAME have stated that between &NUM and &NUM of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the next &NUM years . 
^ This is a &NAME Dollar industry and of the &NUM , &NUM millionaires in the &NAME , &NUM ( &NUM , &NUM ) made their fortune in the last few years in &NAME . 
^ Moreover , statistics show &NUM people become millionaires everyday through &NAME &NAME . 
^ You may have heard this story before , but over the summer &NAME &NAME made an appearance on the &NAME &NAME &NAME . 
^ &NAME asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . 
^ Without hesitating , &NAME said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . 
^ The audience started to hoot and boo him . 
^ He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response - ' That 's why I 'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! ' 
^ With network marketing you have &NUM sources of income . 
^ Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . 
^ Residual income is the secret of the wealthy . 
^ It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . 
^ In network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . 
^ The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers . 
^ Fortunately , sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . 
^ My name is &NAME &NAME . 
^ &NUM years ago , the corporation I worked for , the past &NUM years , down-sized and my position was eliminated . 
^ After many unproductive job interviews , I decided to open my own business . 
^ Over the past year , I incurred many unforeseen financial problems . 
^ I owed my family , friends and creditors over $ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ I just could n't seem to make ends meet . 
^ I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . 
^ AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life , FINANCIALLY , FOREVER ! ! ! 
^ In mid December , I received this program via e-mail . 
^ &NUM month 's prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . 
^ All of the programs I received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . 
^ They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . 
^ One claimed that I would make a million dollars in &NUM year ... it did n't tell me I 'd have to write a best selling book to make it ! 
^ But , as I was saying , in December of &NUM I received this program . 
^ I did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . 
^ THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT ! 
^ After reading it several times , to make sure I was reading it correctly , I could n't believe my eyes . 
^ Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON . 
^ I could invest as much as I wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . 
^ After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out , I would at least get my money back . 
^ But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . 
^ So I checked it out with the &NAME &NAME Office ( &NUM &NUM 24-hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! 
^ After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER , I decided ' WHY NOT . ' 
^ Initially I sent out &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ The great thing about e-mail is that I do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . 
^ I 'm telling you as it is , I hope it does n't turn you off , but I promised myself that I would not ' rip-off ' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . 
^ In less than &NUM week , I was starting to receive orders for REPORT # &NUM . 
^ By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . 
^ Your goal is to 'RECEIVE at least &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . 
^ If you do n't, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO ! ' 
^ My first step in making $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM days was done . 
^ By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . 
^ Your goal is to 'RECEIVE AT LEAST &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . 
^ IF NOT , SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO . 
^ ONCE YOU HAVE &NUM ORDERS , THE REST IS EASY , RELAX , YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $ &NUM , &NUM GOAL . ' Well , I had &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , &NUM more than I needed . 
^ So I sat back and relaxed . 
^ By March &NUM , of my e-mailing of &NUM , &NUM , I received $ &NUM , &NUM with more coming in every day . 
^ I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car . 
^ Please take time to read the attached program , IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER ! 
^ Remember , it wo n't work if you do n't try it . 
^ This program does work , but you must follow it EXACTLY ! 
^ Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . 
^ It wo n't work , you 'll lose out on a lot of money ! 
^ In order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , and &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM and you will make $ &NUM , &NUM or more in &NUM days . 
^ I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS ! 
^ If you choose not to participate in this program , I am sorry . 
^ It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . 
^ If you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . 
^ If you are a business owner and in financial trouble , as I was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a good luck sign . 
^ I DID ! 
^ Sincerely , 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ &NAME Do you have any idea what $ &NUM , &NUM looks like piled up on a kitchen table ? 
^ IT 'S AWESOME ! 
^ &CHAR PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM : 
^ By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program , one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . 
^ Let me tell you a little about myself . 
^ I had a profitable business for &NUM years . 
^ Then in &NUM my business began falling off . 
^ I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . 
^ Finally , I figured it out . 
^ It was n't me , it was the economy . 
^ &NAME and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since &NUM . 
^ I do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate ... because many of you know from first hand experience . 
^ There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . 
^ The middle class was vanishing . 
^ Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . 
^ Those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . 
^ As the saying goes , ' THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER . ' The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to 'move up ' or ' get &NAME ' . 
^ You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with ' NO RISK ' and ' JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT . ' You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . 
^ I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . 
^ I have already made over &NUM MILLION DOLLARS ! 
^ I have retired from the program after sending out over &NUM , &NUM programs . 
^ Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED . 
^ Do not change it in any way . 
^ It works exceedingly well as it is now . 
^ Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . 
^ One of the people you send this to may send out &NUM , &NUM ... and your name will be on everyone of them ! 
^ Remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . 
^ So my friend , I have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , IT IS NOW UP TO YOU ! 
^ HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WORKS 
^ HERE 'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU &NUM OF DOLLARS 
^ INSTRUCTIONS : 
^ This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS &NUM % , EVERY TIME . 
^ I am sure that you could use up to $ &NUM , &NUM or more in the next &NUM days . 
^ Before you say ' BULL ... ' , please read this program carefully . 
^ This is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . 
^ Basically , this is what you do : As with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . 
^ Every state in the &NAME allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent . 
^ YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL , so you are not involved in personal selling . 
^ You do it privately in your own home , store or office . 
^ This is the GREATEST &NAME Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere : 
^ This is what you MUST do : 
^ &NUM Order all &NUM reports shown on the list below ( you ca n't sell them if you do n't order them ) . 
^ * For each report , send $ &NAME , or $ &NAME , or $ &NAME CASH , the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS , and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . 
^ MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS ! 
^ * When you place your order , make sure you order each of the &NUM reports . 
^ You will need all &NUM reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . 
^ * Within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the &NUM reports . 
^ Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the &NUM , 000's of people who will order them from you . 
^ &NUM IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps ' &CHAR ' through ' &CHAR ' or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . 
^ Once you understand the way this works , you 'll also see how it does n't work if you change it . 
^ Remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . 
^ a. Look below for the listing of available reports . 
^ b. After you 've ordered the &NUM reports , take this letter and remove the name and address under REPORT # &NUM . 
^ This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ &NUM , &NUM ! 
^ c. Move the name and address under REPORT # &NUM down to REPORT # &NUM . 
^ d. Move the name and address under REPORT # &NUM down to REPORT # &NUM . 
^ e. Move the name and address under REPORT # &NUM down to REPORT # &NUM . 
^ f. Insert your name / address in the REPORT # &NUM position . 
^ Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY ! 
^ &NUM Take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . 
^ Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter . 
^ &NUM Now you 're ready to start an advertising campaign on the WORLD WIDE &NAME ! 
^ SEND OUT THIS LETTER ( with your name added ) TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN , EVEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY . 
^ Advertising on the &NAME can be very , very inexpensive , and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise . 
^ Another avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists . 
^ You can buy these lists for under $ &NUM / &NUM , &NUM addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you . 
^ BE SURE TO START YOUR &NAME CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY ! 
^ &NUM For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered . 
^ THAT 'S IT ! 
^ ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME- DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS ! 
^ This will help guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out , with YOUR name and address on it , will be prompt because they ca n't advertise until they receive the report ! 
^ To grow fast be prompt and courteous . 
^ AVAILABLE REPORTS 
^ * * * Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME * * * &NAME : 
^ - ALWAYS SEND $ &NAME , or $ &NAME , or $ &NAME CASH FOR EACH REPORT 
^ - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA THE QUICKEST DELIVERY

^ - On one of those sheets of paper , include : ( &CHAR ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( &CHAR ) your e-mail address , and ( &CHAR ) your postal address .

^ THANK 'S TO THE COMPUTER &NAME AND THE INTERNET 
^ AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : 
^ PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! 
^ Does this headline look familiar ? 
^ Of course it does . 
^ You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . 
^ And reported elsewhere in the world . 
^ His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . 
^ Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . 
^ 'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year ' . 
^ The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . 
^ He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . 
^ Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of ' Report ' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . 
^ Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ ' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out ' , says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . 
^ The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ ' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work ' , the boy continues . 
^ Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . 
^ ' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . 
^ There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . 
^ I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) ' . 
^ He goes on , ' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all ' . 
^ Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework ' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . 
^ ' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' Please send me report number &NAME ' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . 
^ [ This is the end of the media release . 
^ If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading . 
^ What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . 
^ BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! 
^ Before you say ' ' &NAME '' , please read the following . 
^ This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately .

^ The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . 
^ Their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can ' follow the simple instruction ' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost '' . 
^ DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER .

^ To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . 
^ There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : 
^ METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
^ Let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . 
^ Let 's also assume 
^ that the mailing receives only a &NUM ( &NUM / &NUM of &NUM ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM ) . 
^ Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . 
^ Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . 
^ Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . 
^ That's3D100 people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people send &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM million e-mail sent out . 
^ The &NUM response is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ THAT 'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH &NUM $ &NUM , &NUM ( half a million dollars ) . 
^ Your total income in this example is : &NUM ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . ... $ &NUM , &NUM ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM 
^ NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME 
^ GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
^ ( I did it was $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM months ) 
^ REMEMBER , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . 
^ Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? 
^ There are &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting , with thousands of more coming on line every day . 
^ Believe me , there is n't any better way to make money ! 
^ METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET 
^ Advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . 
^ Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . 
^ We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . 
^ For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . 
^ That 's it . 
^ Always provide same day service on all orders . 
^ This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . 
^ The reason for the ' cash ' is not because this is illegal or somehow ' wrong ' . 
^ It is simply about time . 
^ Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc. Concealing it is simply so no &NUM can &NAME there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . 
^ ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . 
^ &NAME : 
^ Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report . 
^ Checks NOT accepted . 
^ Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &NUM sheets of paper or foil will also work . 
^ On one of those sheets of paper , write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address .

^ In view of this I got your contact through my search via business report from your web site to see if you can assist . 
^ I will give you &NUM of the total . 
^ Upon the receipt of your response , I will send to you by fax or e-mail the application letter , bank 's fax number and the next step to take . 
^ I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within &NUM banking days , after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased . 
^ When you receive this letter . 
^ Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including your private &NAME / &NAME numbers for quick communication .

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ I am Mrs. &NAME &NAME , the widow of the late Gen . 
^ &NAME &NAME former Nigerian Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest . 
^ Since after my husband 's death my family is under restriction of movement and that not withstanding , we are being molested , policed and our Bank Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Civilian Government . 
^ Furthermore , my eldest son is in detention by the Nigerian Government for more interrogation about my husband 's assists and some vital documents . 
^ Following the recent discovery of my husband 's Bank Account by the Nigerian Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US $ 700Million and DM450Milllion was logged . 
^ I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move out the sum of US $ 25Million Dollars , which was secretly lodged in a trunk box and deposited with a Security Company as materials of Inheritance . 
^ I therefore personally , appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to move this money into your country where I believe it will be safe since &NUM cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian Government . 
^ You can also contact me through my family attorney &NAME &NAME &NAME ( SAN ) on his e-mail address : &EMAIL and my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face to face meeting outside Nigerian , in order to liaise with you toward effective completion of this transaction . 
^ However , arrangements have been put in place to move this money out of the country in a secret vault through a diplomatic security company , as soon as you indicate your interest , forward to my lawyer your Telephone Number , &NAME &NAME and your Postal Address so that he can send to you the Certificate of Deposit and other necessary documents , so that you can help to claim the luggage . 
^ Conclusively , we have agreed to offer you &NUM of the total sum while &NUM is to be held on trust by you until we decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government . 
^ Please reply urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity . 
^ Best &NAME , &NAME &NAME abacha ( Mrs. )

^ PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! 
^ Does this headline look familiar ? 
^ Of course it does . 
^ You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . 
^ And reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods &NAME &NAME ) . 
^ His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . 
^ Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ Five-dollar bills , &NUM , &NUM and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . 
^ 'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year ' . 
^ The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had &NAME came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . 
^ Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of ' Report ' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . 
^ Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ ' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out ' , says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . 
^ The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ ' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work ' , the boy continues . 
^ Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . 
^ ' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . 
^ There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . 
^ I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) ' . 
^ He goes on , ' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all ' . 
^ Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework ' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . 
^ ' I did n't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . 
^ I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] &WEBSITE time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . ' 
^ &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' Please send me report number &NAME ' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . 
^ [ This is the end of the media release . 
^ If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM please continue reading . 
^ What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO 
^ - just follow the simple instructions ] . 
^ BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! 
^ Before you say ' &NAME ' , please read the following . 
^ This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . 
^ Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . 
^ The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . 
^ Their findings proved once and for all that there are ' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost ' . 
^ DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . 
^ NOTE * follow the directons below , I hade best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . 
^ I have been asked many times to recommend whom to use . 
^ However , after using &NUM particular company many , many times and had absolutely no problems with them . 
^ I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of a discount offer . 
^ They will send &NUM million email offers for $ &NUM or &NUM million for $ &NUM .. Remember this is recommended not Required . 
^ In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . 
^ I have been extremely successful using the this company . 
^ They send out the offers , and all I do is accept money for reports , then I send back to the people as soon as possible 
^ This is what one had to say : ' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . 
^ I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . 
^ I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . 
^ To my astonishment , I received total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in ' . 
^ &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . 
^ Here is another testimonial : ' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . 
^ But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . 
^ I followed the simple instructions and walaa . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $ &NUM . 
^ &NUM but the next &NUM months after that I made a total of $ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ So far , in the past &NUM months by re- entering the program , I have made over $ &NUM , &NUM and I am playing it again . 
^ The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything . ' 
^ More testimonials later but first , 
^ +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++

^ To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . 
^ There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : 
^ METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
^ Let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , 000e-mails each . 
^ Let 's also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . 
^ Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . 
^ Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . 
^ Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . 
^ That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ THAT 'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH3D $ &NUM , &NUM ( half million ) . 
^ Your total income in this example is : &NUM . . ... $ &NUM &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM . . . . . ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM 
^ NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME . 
^ GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
^ REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . 
^ Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , 000e-mails each or more ? 
^ There are over &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting . 
^ Believe me , many people will do just that , and more !

^ How much are we making ? 
^ Anywhere from $ &NUM to $ &NUM per &NAME are real people , and most of us work at this business part-time . 
^ But keep in mind , we do WORK at it -- I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up , do no work , and rake in the cash . 
^ That kind of job does not exist . 
^ But if you are willing to put in &NUM hours per week , this might be just the thing you are looking for . 
^ This is not income that is determined by luck , or work that is done FOR you -- it is all based on your effort .

^ We 'll then send you info , and you can make up your own mind . 
^ Looking forward to hearing from you ! 
^ Sincerely , 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME

^ PARENTS OF 15-YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! 
^ Does this headline look familiar ? 
^ Of course it does . 
^ You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . 
^ And reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - &NAME &NAME ) . 
^ His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet.Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ Five-dollar bills , &NUM , &NUM and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles &NAME first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year ' . 
^ The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . 
^ He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . 
^ Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of ' Report ' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . 
^ Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ ' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out ' , says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and to add your name to the top of the list . 
^ The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ ' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work ' , the boy continues . 
^ Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . 
^ ' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . 
^ There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . 
^ I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) ' . 
^ He goes on , ' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all ' . 
^ Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework ' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . 
^ ' I did n't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . 
^ I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] &WEBSITE time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . ' 
^ Surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . 
^ The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all . 
^ In fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' Please send me report number &NAME ' . 
^ This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . 
^ [ This is the end of the media release . 
^ If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM - please continue reading . 
^ What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO 
^ - just follow the simple instructions ] . 
^ BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! 
^ Before you say ' &NAME ' , please read the following . 
^ This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . 
^ Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . 
^ The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . 
^ Their findings proved once and for all that there are ' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost ' . 
^ DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . 
^ NOTE * follow the directions below , I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . 
^ I have been asked many times to recommend whom to use . 
^ However , after using &NUM particular company many , many times and had absolutely no problems with them . 
^ I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of a discount offer . 
^ They will send &NUM million email offers for $ &NUM or &NUM million for $ &NUM .. Remember this is recommended not required . 
^ In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . 
^ I have been extremely successful using the this company . 
^ They &CHAR nd out the offers , and all I do is accept the money for reports , which I send back to the people as soon as possible . 
^ This is what one had to say : ' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . 
^ I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . 
^ I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . 
^ To my astonishment , I received total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in ' . 
^ &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . 
^ Here is another testimonial : ' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . 
^ But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . 
^ I followed the simple instructions and walaa ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $ &NUM . 
^ &NUM but the next &NUM months after that I made a total of $ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ So far , in the past &NUM months by re- entering the program , I have made over $ &NUM , &NUM and I am playing it again . 
^ The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything . '

^ There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : 
^ METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
^ Let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . 
^ Let 's also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . 
^ Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . 
^ Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . 
^ Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . 
^ That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . 
^ The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . 
^ THAT 'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH3D $ &NUM , &NUM ( half million ) .

^ Good day , 
^ My proposal to you will be very surprising , as we have not had any personal contact . 
^ However , I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction , which I propose to you as a person of transparency , honesty and caliber . 
^ Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you . 
^ My name is &NAME &NAME cousin and Personal Assistant of &NAME &NAME &NAME , the leader UNITA ( &NAME &NAME for the Total independence of &NAME ) . 
^ I got your email address from network directory . 
^ I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy . 
^ You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with the government troops of &NAME , led by President &NAME &NAME , on friday 22nd &NAME , &NUM . 
^ Now Mr. &NAME &NAME and general &NAME &NAME who were my Uncle 's second in command , has assumed office as leader of UNITA . 
^ In spite of this , &NAME is like a herd of cattle without shepherd . 
^ Prominent members like &NAME &NAME are still lobbying to oust them and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to their ambitions , including General &NAME lukamba , are planning to kill me . 
^ For more information check &WEBSITE 
^ However , I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any way interested in wars , this is why I secretly left &NAME and come here ( &NAME ) to seek political asylum . 
^ I am sincerely seeking for your urgent help in respect to safe keeping of some of my Uncle 's money that arose from &NAME sales . 
^ This money ( &NAME $ 18.5million ) , was already on its way to my Uncle 's Swiss Bank account . 
^ It was on transit with a safe deposit company here in &NAME , when the tragic incident of my Uncle 's death occurred . 
^ As a matter of fact , this is the reason I chose to come to &NAME to seek political asylum . 
^ It is very clear with the way things are now , that President &NAME &NAME will lobby the International Community to freeze my Uncle 's assets and accounts abroad , to ground UNITA , since he has already done this in &NAME . 
^ I plan to use this money to safeguard my future . 
^ It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary , and an act of desperation on my part , in order not to lose this money . 
^ Please , treat this contact with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons . 
^ The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the funds from the security company , after which , it will be deposited in an account in your name , with my name as next of kin . 
^ The money shall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted , and I have the permit to conduct business , then you will transfer the account to me . 
^ Meanwhile , the money can be invested into risk-free profitable ventures , and there will an agreement to protect my interest . 
^ I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment from the security company . 
^ For your reliable assistance , I will reward you with &NUM of the money , and we shall use &NUM to carry out every expenses that we come across during the transaction and the investment process . 
^ The remainder of the &NUM , shall be given to a charity of your choice . 
^ I thank you in advance in anticipation for your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal . 
^ Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me . 
^ This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part . 
^ NOTE : your prompt response will be appreciated . 
^ Sincerely , 
^ &NAME &NAME .

^ LEGITIMATE AND LEGAL 
^ THIS IS A LEGITIMATE , LEGAL , MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY . 
^ It does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . 
^ If you believe that someday you 'll get that big break that you 've been waiting for , THIS IS IT ! 
^ Simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . 
^ This e-mail marketing program works perfectly ... &NUM , EVERY TIME . 
^ E-mail is the sales tool of the future . 
^ Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising NOW ! ! ! 
^ The longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . 
^ Get your piece of this program now ! 
^ MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING ( &NAME ) has finally gained respectability . 
^ It is being taught in the &NAME Business School , both &NAME Research and the &NAME &NAME &NAME have stated that between &NUM and &NUM of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the next &NUM years . 
^ This is a &NAME Dollar industry and of the &NUM , &NUM millionaires in the &NAME , &NUM ( &NUM , &NUM ) made their fortune in the last few years in &NAME . 
^ Moreover , statistics show &NUM people become millionaires everyday through &NAME &NAME . 
^ You may have heard this story before , but over the summer &NAME &NAME made an appearance on the &NAME &NAME &NAME . 
^ &NAME asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . 
^ Without hesitating , &NAME said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . 
^ The audience started to hoot and boo him . 
^ He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response - ' That 's why I 'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! ' 
^ With network marketing you have &NUM sources of income . 
^ Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . 
^ Residual income is the secret of the wealthy . 
^ It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . 
^ In network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . 
^ The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers . 
^ Fortunately , sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . 
^ My name is &NAME &NAME . 
^ &NUM years ago , the corporation I worked for , the past &NUM years , down-sized and my position was eliminated . 
^ After many unproductive job interviews , I decided to open my own business . 
^ Over the past year , I incurred many unforeseen financial problems . 
^ I owed my family , friends and creditors over $ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ I just could n't seem to make ends meet . 
^ I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . 
^ AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life , FINANCIALLY , FOREVER ! ! ! 
^ In mid December , I received this program via e-mail . 
^ &NUM month 's prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . 
^ All of the programs I received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . 
^ They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . 
^ One claimed that I would make a million dollars in &NUM year ... it did n't tell me I 'd have to write a best selling book to make it ! 
^ But , as I was saying , in December of &NUM I received this program . 
^ I did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . 
^ THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT ! 
^ After reading it several times , to make sure I was reading it correctly , I could n't believe my eyes . 
^ Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON . 
^ I could invest as much as I wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . 
^ After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out , I would at least get my money back . 
^ But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . 
^ So I checked it out with the &NAME &NAME Office ( &NUM &NUM 24-hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! 
^ After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER , I decided ' WHY NOT . ' 
^ Initially I sent out &NUM , &NUM e-mails . 
^ The great thing about e-mail is that I do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . 
^ I 'm telling you as it is , I hope it does n't turn you off , but I promised myself that I would not ' rip-off ' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . 
^ In less than &NUM week , I was starting to receive orders for REPORT # &NUM . 
^ By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . 
^ Your goal is to 'RECEIVE at least &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . 
^ If you do n't, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO ! ' 
^ My first step in making $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM days was done . 
^ By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . 
^ Your goal is to 'RECEIVE AT LEAST &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . 
^ IF NOT , SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO . 
^ ONCE YOU HAVE &NUM ORDERS , THE REST IS EASY , RELAX , YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $ &NUM , &NUM GOAL . ' Well , I had &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , &NUM more than I needed . 
^ So I sat back and relaxed . 
^ By March &NUM , of my e-mailing of &NUM , &NUM , I received $ &NUM , &NUM with more coming in every day . 
^ I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car . 
^ Please take time to read the attached program , IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER ! 
^ Remember , it wo n't work if you do n't try it . 
^ This program does work , but you must follow it EXACTLY ! 
^ Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . 
^ It wo n't work , you 'll lose out on a lot of money ! 
^ In order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , and &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM and you will make $ &NUM , &NUM or more in &NUM days . 
^ I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS ! 
^ If you choose not to participate in this program , I am sorry . 
^ It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . 
^ If you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . 
^ If you are a business owner and in financial trouble , as I was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a good luck sign . 
^ I DID ! 
^ Sincerely , 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ &NAME Do you have any idea what $ &NUM , &NUM looks like piled up on a kitchen table ? 
^ IT 'S AWESOME ! 
^ &CHAR PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM : 
^ By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program , one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . 
^ Let me tell you a little about myself . 
^ I had a profitable business for &NUM years . 
^ Then in &NUM my business began falling off . 
^ I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . 
^ Finally , I figured it out . 
^ It was n't me , it was the economy . 
^ &NAME and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since &NUM . 
^ I do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate ... because many of you know from first hand experience . 
^ There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . 
^ The middle class was vanishing . 
^ Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . 
^ Those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . 
^ As the saying goes , ' THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER . ' The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to 'move up ' or ' get &NAME ' . 
^ You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with ' NO RISK ' and ' JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT . ' You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . 
^ I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . 
^ I have already made over &NUM MILLION DOLLARS ! 
^ I have retired from the program after sending out over &NUM , &NUM programs . 
^ Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED . 
^ Do not change it in any way . 
^ It works exceedingly well as it is now . 
^ Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . 
^ One of the people you send this to may send out &NUM , &NUM ... and your name will be on everyone of them ! 
^ Remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . 
^ So my friend , I have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , IT IS NOW UP TO YOU ! 
^ HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WORKS 
^ HERE 'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU &NUM OF DOLLARS 
^ INSTRUCTIONS : 
^ This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS &NUM % , EVERY TIME . 
^ I am sure that you could use up to $ &NUM , &NUM or more in the next &NUM days . 
^ Before you say ' BULL ... ' , please read this program carefully . 
^ This is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . 
^ Basically , this is what you do : As with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . 
^ Every state in the &NAME allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent . 
^ YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL , so you are not involved in personal selling . 
^ You do it privately in your own home , store or office . 
^ This is the GREATEST &NAME Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere : 
^ This is what you MUST do : 
^ &NUM Order all &NUM reports shown on the list below ( you ca n't sell them if you do n't order them ) . 
^ * For each report , send $ &NAME , or $ &NAME , or $ &NAME CASH , the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS , and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . 
^ MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS ! 
^ * When you place your order , make sure you order each of the &NUM reports . 
^ You will need all &NUM reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . 
^ * Within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the &NUM reports . 
^ Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the &NUM , 000's of people who will order them from you . 
^ &NUM IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps ' &CHAR ' through ' &CHAR ' or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . 
^ Once you understand the way this works , you 'll also see how it does n't work if you change it . 
^ Remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . 
^ a. Look below for the listing of available reports . 
^ b. After you 've ordered the &NUM reports , take this letter and remove the name and address under REPORT # &NUM . 
^ This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ &NUM , &NUM ! 
^ c. Move the name and address under REPORT # &NUM down to REPORT # &NUM . 
^ d. Move the name and address under REPORT # &NUM down to REPORT # &NUM . 
^ e. Move the name and address under REPORT # &NUM down to REPORT # &NUM . 
^ f. Insert your name / address in the REPORT # &NUM position . 
^ Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY ! 
^ &NUM Take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . 
^ Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter . 
^ &NUM Now you 're ready to start an advertising campaign on the WORLD WIDE &NAME ! 
^ SEND OUT THIS LETTER ( with your name added ) TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN , EVEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY . 
^ Advertising on the &NAME can be very , very inexpensive , and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise . 
^ Another avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists . 
^ You can buy these lists for under $ &NUM / &NUM , &NUM addresses or you can pay someone to take care of it for you . 
^ BE SURE TO START YOUR &NAME CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY ! 
^ &NUM For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered . 
^ THAT 'S IT ! 
^ ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME- DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS ! 
^ This will help guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out , with YOUR name and address on it , will be prompt because they ca n't advertise until they receive the report ! 
^ To grow fast be prompt and courteous . 
^ AVAILABLE REPORTS 
^ * * * Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME * * * &NAME : 
^ - ALWAYS SEND $ &NAME , or $ &NAME , or $ &NAME CASH FOR EACH REPORT 
^ - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA THE QUICKEST DELIVERY 
^ - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &NUM sheets of paper 
^ - On one of those sheets of paper , include : ( &CHAR ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( &CHAR ) your e-mail address , and ( &CHAR ) your postal address .

^ PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! 
^ Does this headline look familiar ? 
^ Of course it does . 
^ You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . 
^ And reported elsewhere in the world . 
^ His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . 
^ Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . 
^ 'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year ' . 
^ The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . 
^ He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . 
^ Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of ' Report ' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . 
^ Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ ' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out ' , says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . 
^ The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ ' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work ' , the boy continues . 
^ Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . 
^ ' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . 
^ There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . 
^ I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) ' . 
^ He goes on , ' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all ' . 
^ Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework ' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . 
^ ' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' Please send me report number &NAME ' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . 
^ [ This is the end of the media release . 
^ If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading .
